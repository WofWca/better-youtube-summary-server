dur="4.92">your full attention I think is really</text><text start="51.18" dur="4.68">important to my like mental health and</text><text start="53.94" dur="3.779">and the way I just stay focused at doing</text><text start="55.86" dur="4.379">everything I&amp;#39;m doing it&amp;#39;s like I decided</text><text start="57.719" dur="3.901">to get into martial arts and it&amp;#39;s um</text><text start="60.239" dur="3.721">it&amp;#39;s awesome I got like a ton of my</text><text start="61.62" dur="4.499">friends into it we all train together</text><text start="63.96" dur="3.6">um we have like a

start="76.5" dur="3.24">that so yeah it was but it was it was</text><text start="78.24" dur="3.72">awesome it was it was just a lot of fun</text><text start="79.74" dur="3.96">you weren&amp;#39;t scared there was no fear I</text><text start="81.96" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t know I I was I was pretty sure</text><text start="83.7" dur="4.38">that I&amp;#39;d that I&amp;#39;d do okay I like the</text><text start="85.68" dur="4.86">confidence um well so for people don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="88.08" dur="4.5">know Jiu Jitsu is a martial art where</text><text start="90.54" dur="6.48">you&amp;#39;re trying to break your opponent&amp;#39;s</text><text start="92.58" dur="7.92">limbs or choke them uh to sleep and do</text><text start="97.02" dur="4.919">so with Grace and uh elegance and</text><text start="100.5" dur="4.38">efficiency and all that kind of stuff</text><text start="101.939" dur="4.081">it&amp;#39;s a uh it&amp;#39;s a kind of art form I</text><text start="104.88" dur="3.599">think that you can do for your whole</text><text start="106.02" dur="4.68">life and it&amp;#39;s a basically a game a sport</text><text start="108.479" dur="4.261">of human chess you can think of there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="110.7" dur="4.08">a lot of strategy there&amp;#39;s a lot of sort</text><text start="112.74" dur="3.9">of interesting human dynamics of using</text><text start="114.78" dur="4.199">leverage and all that kind of stuff and</text><text start="116.64" dur="3.72">uh it&amp;#39;s kind of incredible what you</text><text start="118.979" dur="3.061">could do you can you could do things</text><text start="120.36" dur="3.48">like a small opponent could defeat a</text><text start="122.04" dur="3.48">much larger opponent and you get to</text><text start="123.84" dur="3.66">understand like the way the mechanics of</text><text start="125.52" dur="4.62">the human body works because of that but</text><text start="127.5" dur="5.04">you certainly can&amp;#39;t be distracted no</text><text start="130.14" dur="5.28">yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a hundred percent Focus</text><text start="132.54" dur="3.839">yeah to to compete I I you know I needed</text><text start="135.42" dur="3.24">to get around the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="136.379" dur="5.401">want it to be like this this big thing</text><text start="138.66" dur="5.219">so basically just I rolled up with a hat</text><text start="141.78" dur="4.5">and sunglasses and I was wearing a</text><text start="143.879" dur="4.141">covered mask and I registered under my</text><text start="146.28" dur="3.84">first and middle name so Mark Elliott</text><text start="148.02" dur="3.66">and um and it wasn&amp;#39;t until I actually</text><text start="150.12" dur="3.06">pulled all that stuff off right before I</text><text start="151.68" dur="3.419">got on the map that I think people knew</text><text start="153.18" dur="4.8">was me so it was it was pretty low-key</text><text start="155.099" dur="4.981">but you&amp;#39;re still a public figure yeah I</text><text start="157.98" dur="4.14">mean I didn&amp;#39;t want to lose right the</text><text start="160.08" dur="3.48">thing you&amp;#39;re partially afraid of is not</text><text start="162.12" dur="4.199">just the losing but being almost like</text><text start="163.56" dur="4.14">embarrassed it&amp;#39;s so raw the sport in</text><text start="166.319" dur="3.06">that like it&amp;#39;s just you and another</text><text start="167.7" dur="3.6">human being there&amp;#39;s a primal aspect</text><text start="169.379" dur="3.121">there oh yeah it&amp;#39;s great for a lot of</text><text start="171.3" dur="2.4">people it could be terrifying especially</text><text start="172.5" dur="3.959">the first time you&amp;#39;re doing the</text><text start="173.7" dur="4.319">competing and it wasn&amp;#39;t for you I see</text><text start="176.459" dur="3.601">the look of excitement in your face yeah</text><text start="178.019" dur="5.401">there was no no fear I just think part</text><text start="180.06" dur="5.52">of learning is failing okay right so I</text><text start="183.42" dur="4.02">mean the main thing like people who who</text><text start="185.58" dur="3.84">train Jiu Jitsu it&amp;#39;s like you need to</text><text start="187.44" dur="2.879">not have pride because I mean all the</text><text start="189.42" dur="2.099">stuff you were talking about before</text><text start="190.319" dur="3.42">about</text><text start="191.519" dur="4.701">you know getting choked or getting you</text><text start="193.739" dur="4.86">know a joint lock it&amp;#39;s um</text><text start="196.22" dur="3.879">you only get into a bad situation if</text><text start="198.599" dur="4.381">you&amp;#39;re not willing to tap once you</text><text start="200.099" dur="4.081">you&amp;#39;ve already lost right and but</text><text start="202.98" dur="2.28">obviously when you&amp;#39;re getting started</text><text start="204.18" dur="3.059">with something you&amp;#39;re not going to be an</text><text start="205.26" dur="3.72">expert about it immediately so you just</text><text start="207.239" dur="3.901">need to to be willing to go with that</text><text start="208.98" dur="3.36">but I think this is like I don&amp;#39;t know I</text><text start="211.14" dur="3.959">mean maybe I&amp;#39;ve just been embarrassed</text><text start="212.34" dur="4.5">enough times in my life yeah I I do that</text><text start="215.099" dur="3.481">there&amp;#39;s a thing where like it has people</text><text start="216.84" dur="3.06">grow up maybe they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text><text start="218.58" dur="3.36">embarrassed or anything they&amp;#39;ve built</text><text start="219.9" dur="4.8">their adult identity and they they kind</text><text start="221.94" dur="4.68">of have a sense of of who they</text><text start="224.7" dur="4.2">they are and what they want to project</text><text start="226.62" dur="4.32">and I don&amp;#39;t know I think maybe to some</text><text start="228.9" dur="4.38">degree</text><text start="230.94" dur="5.28">you know your ability to keep doing</text><text start="233.28" dur="6.06">interesting things is your willingness</text><text start="236.22" dur="6.72">to be embarrassed again and go back to</text><text start="239.34" dur="6.3">step one and start as a beginner and get</text><text start="242.94" dur="4.799">your ass kicked and you know look stupid</text><text start="245.64" dur="3.06">doing things and you know I think so</text><text start="247.739" dur="2.941">many of the things that we&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="248.7" dur="3.42">whether it&amp;#39;s whether it&amp;#39;s this I mean</text><text start="250.68" dur="3.779">this is just like a kind of a physical</text><text start="252.12" dur="3.959">part of my life but</text><text start="254.459" dur="4.68">um but running the company it&amp;#39;s like we</text><text start="256.079" dur="4.261">just take on new adventures and</text><text start="259.139" dur="2.641">um</text><text start="260.34" dur="3.419">you know all the big things that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="261.78" dur="4.56">doing I think of as like 10 plus year</text><text start="263.759" dur="4.801">missions that we&amp;#39;re on where you know</text><text start="266.34" dur="3.419">often early on you know people doubt</text><text start="268.56" dur="3.48">that we&amp;#39;re gonna be able to do it and</text><text start="269.759" dur="3.72">the initial work seems kind of silly and</text><text start="272.04" dur="2.879">our whole ethos says we don&amp;#39;t want to</text><text start="273.479" dur="3">wait until something is perfect to put</text><text start="274.919" dur="3.72">it out there we want to get it out</text><text start="276.479" dur="3">quickly and get feedback on it and so I</text><text start="278.639" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t know I mean there&amp;#39;s probably just</text><text start="279.479" dur="4.261">something about how I approach things in</text><text start="281.699" dur="3.241">there but I just kind of think that the</text><text start="283.74" dur="2.58">moment that you decide that you&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="284.94" dur="2.52">to be too embarrassed to try something</text><text start="286.32" dur="3.84">new then you&amp;#39;re not going to learn</text><text start="287.46" dur="4.98">anything anymore but uh like I mentioned</text><text start="290.16" dur="4.08">that fear that anxiety could be there</text><text start="292.44" dur="4.259">could creep up every once in a while do</text><text start="294.24" dur="4.56">do you feel that and especially</text><text start="296.699" dur="5.601">stressful moments sort of outside did</text><text start="298.8" dur="6.78">you just met just at work</text><text start="302.3" dur="5.2">stressful moments big decision days big</text><text start="305.58" dur="3.119">decision moments how do you deal with</text><text start="307.5" dur="3">that fear how do you deal with that</text><text start="308.699" dur="3.601">anxiety the thing that stresses me out</text><text start="310.5" dur="5.34">the most is always is always the people</text><text start="312.3" dur="6.42">challenges you know I kind of think that</text><text start="315.84" dur="5.1">um you know strategy questions</text><text start="318.72" dur="4.5">you know I tend to have enough</text><text start="320.94" dur="3.9">conviction around the values of what</text><text start="323.22" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text><text start="324.84" dur="4.38">what I think matters and what I want our</text><text start="327.24" dur="4.2">company to stand for that</text><text start="329.22" dur="4.14">those don&amp;#39;t really keep me up at night</text><text start="331.44" dur="3.66">that much I mean I I kind of you know</text><text start="333.36" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s not that I I get everything right</text><text start="335.1" dur="4.14">of course I don&amp;#39;t right I mean we make a</text><text start="337.38" dur="2.7">lot of mistakes but</text><text start="339.24" dur="3.36">um</text><text start="340.08" dur="5.459">but I at least have a pretty strong</text><text start="342.6" dur="5.46">sense of where I want us to go on that</text><text start="345.539" dur="4.861">the the thing in in running a company</text><text start="348.06" dur="4.02">for you know almost 20 years now one of</text><text start="350.4" dur="3">the things that&amp;#39;s been pretty clear is</text><text start="352.08" dur="3.54">when you have</text><text start="353.4" dur="3.84">a team that&amp;#39;s cohesive</text><text start="355.62" dur="3.419">you can get</text><text start="357.24" dur="4.62">almost anything done</text><text start="359.039" dur="5.22">and you know you can you can run through</text><text start="361.86" dur="4.619">super hard challenges</text><text start="364.259" dur="4.261">um you can make hard decisions and push</text><text start="366.479" dur="4.56">really hard to to do the best work even</text><text start="368.52" dur="4.98">you know and kind of optimize something</text><text start="371.039" dur="4.201">super well but when when there&amp;#39;s that</text><text start="373.5" dur="3.96">tension I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s when when</text><text start="375.24" dur="4.08">things get really tough and you know</text><text start="377.46" dur="3.36">when I talk to other friends who run</text><text start="379.32" dur="2.939">other companies and things like that I</text><text start="380.82" dur="3.06">think one of the things that I actually</text><text start="382.259" dur="3.841">spend a disproportionate amount of time</text><text start="383.88" dur="6.3">on in running this company is just</text><text start="386.1" dur="6.48">fostering a pretty tight core group of</text><text start="390.18" dur="6.359">of people who are running the company uh</text><text start="392.58" dur="5.22">with me and that to me is is kind of the</text><text start="396.539" dur="3.361">thing that</text><text start="397.8" dur="3.72">both makes it fun right having having</text><text start="399.9" dur="2.82">you know friends and people you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="401.52" dur="2.7">worked with for a while and new people</text><text start="402.72" dur="3.3">and New Perspectives but like a pretty</text><text start="404.22" dur="4.44">tight group who can who you can go work</text><text start="406.02" dur="4.019">on some of these crazy things with</text><text start="408.66" dur="3.3">um but to me that&amp;#39;s also the most</text><text start="410.039" dur="3.78">stressful thing is when when there are</text><text start="411.96" dur="3.66">when there&amp;#39;s tension</text><text start="413.819" dur="3.961">um you know that&amp;#39;s that that weighs on</text><text start="415.62" dur="4.199">me I think the you know just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="417.78" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s maybe not surprising I mean we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="419.819" dur="4.141">like a very people focused company and</text><text start="422.1" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s the the people is the the part of</text><text start="423.96" dur="2.94">it that that</text><text start="425.58" dur="2.94">um you know weighs on me the most to</text><text start="426.9" dur="3.419">make sure that we get right but yeah</text><text start="428.52" dur="3.299">that that I&amp;#39;d say across everything that</text><text start="430.319" dur="3.961">we do is probably</text><text start="431.819" dur="7.261">the big thing so when there&amp;#39;s tension in</text><text start="434.28" dur="8.039">that inner circle of of close folks so</text><text start="439.08" dur="5.7">when you trust those folks to help you</text><text start="442.319" dur="8.16">make difficult decisions</text><text start="444.78" dur="7.5">about uh Facebook WhatsApp Instagram the</text><text start="450.479" dur="3.12">future of the company and the metaverse</text><text start="452.28" dur="3.419">or the AI</text><text start="453.599" dur="4.861">uh how do you build that close-knit</text><text start="455.699" dur="5.161">group of folks uh to make those</text><text start="458.46" dur="4.56">difficult decisions is there people that</text><text start="460.86" dur="4.44">if they have critical voices very</text><text start="463.02" dur="4.619">different perspectives on yeah focusing</text><text start="465.3" dur="4.14">on the past versus the future all that</text><text start="467.639" dur="4.201">kind of stuff yeah I mean I think for</text><text start="469.44" dur="4.62">one thing it&amp;#39;s just spending a lot of</text><text start="471.84" dur="4.38">time with whatever the group is that you</text><text start="474.06" dur="3.78">want to be that Core Group</text><text start="476.22" dur="3.72">grappling with all of the biggest</text><text start="477.84" dur="4.859">challenges and that requires a fair</text><text start="479.94" dur="5.099">amount of openness and you know so I</text><text start="482.699" dur="3.481">mean a lot of how I I run the company is</text><text start="485.039" dur="3.901">you know it&amp;#39;s like every Monday morning</text><text start="486.18" dur="7.019">we get our it&amp;#39;s about the top 30 people</text><text start="488.94" dur="5.46">together and we and this is a group that</text><text start="493.199" dur="3.06">just worked together for a long period</text><text start="494.4" dur="3.96">of time and I mean people people rotate</text><text start="496.259" dur="3.901">in I mean new people join people leave</text><text start="498.36" dur="3.6">the company people go to other roles in</text><text start="500.16" dur="4.379">the company so it&amp;#39;s not the the same</text><text start="501.96" dur="5.1">group over time but then we spend you</text><text start="504.539" dur="4.141">know a lot of times a couple of hours a</text><text start="507.06" dur="3.66">lot of the time it&amp;#39;s you know can be</text><text start="508.68" dur="4.26">somewhat unstructured we like I&amp;#39;ll come</text><text start="510.72" dur="4.92">with maybe a few topics that I that are</text><text start="512.94" dur="4.68">top of mind for me but I&amp;#39;ll ask other</text><text start="515.64" dur="3.48">people to bring things and people you</text><text start="517.62" dur="3.599">know raise questions whether it&amp;#39;s okay</text><text start="519.12" dur="3.419">there&amp;#39;s an issue happening in some</text><text start="521.219" dur="3.301">country</text><text start="522.539" dur="3.661">um with with some policy issue there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="524.52" dur="3.12">like a new technology that&amp;#39;s developing</text><text start="526.2" dur="2.699">here we&amp;#39;re having an issue with this</text><text start="527.64" dur="3.18">partner</text><text start="528.899" dur="4.801">um you know there&amp;#39;s a design trade-off</text><text start="530.82" dur="4.26">and WhatsApp between two things that</text><text start="533.7" dur="2.699">that end up</text><text start="535.08" dur="3.54">um being values that we care about</text><text start="536.399" dur="3.421">deeply and we need to kind of decide</text><text start="538.62" dur="2.399">where we want to be on that and I just</text><text start="539.82" dur="3.72">think over time</text><text start="541.019" dur="4.201">when um you know by working through a</text><text start="543.54" dur="4.26">lot of issues with people and doing it</text><text start="545.22" dur="5.46">openly people develop an intuition for</text><text start="547.8" dur="6.78">each other and a bond in camaraderie</text><text start="550.68" dur="5.52">um and to me developing that is is like</text><text start="554.58" dur="3.24">a lot of the fun part of running a</text><text start="556.2" dur="3.48">company or doing anything right I think</text><text start="557.82" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s like having having people who are</text><text start="559.68" dur="2.76">kind of along on the journey that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="561.3" dur="3.3">that you feel like you&amp;#39;re doing it with</text><text start="562.44" dur="4.86">nothing is ever just one person doing it</text><text start="564.6" dur="4.14">other people that disagree also yeah</text><text start="567.3" dur="4.14">within that group it&amp;#39;s a fairly</text><text start="568.74" dur="4.68">combative group okay so combat is part</text><text start="571.44" dur="4.68">of it so this is making decisions on</text><text start="573.42" dur="5.46">design engineering</text><text start="576.12" dur="4.02">uh policy everything everything</text><text start="578.88" dur="3.899">everything</text><text start="580.14" dur="4.02">yeah I have to ask just back to jiu</text><text start="582.779" dur="3.06">jitsu for a little bit what&amp;#39;s your</text><text start="584.16" dur="4.619">favorite submission now that you&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="585.839" dur="5.94">doing it what&amp;#39;s uh how do you like to</text><text start="588.779" dur="4.56">submit your opponent Mark Zuckerberg I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="591.779" dur="4.141">in</text><text start="593.339" dur="5.881">well first of all I um</text><text start="595.92" dur="6.539">do you prefer nogi or Gigi Jiu Jitsu so</text><text start="599.22" dur="6.48">ghee is this outfit you wear that uh is</text><text start="602.459" dur="4.981">maybe mimics clothing so you can choke</text><text start="605.7" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s like a kimono it&amp;#39;s like the</text><text start="607.44" dur="4.16">traditional martial arts</text><text start="610.08" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="611.6" dur="4.6">that you could choke people with yes</text><text start="613.86" dur="6.12">well it&amp;#39;s got the lapels yes yeah</text><text start="616.2" dur="7.62">um so I like Jiu Jitsu I also really</text><text start="619.98" dur="7.2">like MMA and so I think nogi more</text><text start="623.82" dur="5.519">closely approximates MMA and I think my</text><text start="627.18" dur="4.26">style is</text><text start="629.339" dur="4.161">um is maybe a little closer to an MMA</text><text start="631.44" dur="4.38">style so like a lot of Jiu Jitsu players</text><text start="633.5" dur="4.18">are fine being on their back right and</text><text start="635.82" dur="4.74">obviously having a good guard is is a</text><text start="637.68" dur="4.08">critical part of of Jiu Jitsu but but in</text><text start="640.56" dur="2.279">MMA you don&amp;#39;t want to be on your back</text><text start="641.76" dur="3.36">right because even if you have control</text><text start="642.839" dur="4.021">you&amp;#39;re just taking punches while you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="645.12" dur="3.3">on your back so</text><text start="646.86" dur="4.26">um so that&amp;#39;s no good do you like being</text><text start="648.42" dur="4.68">on top my style is I&amp;#39;m probably more</text><text start="651.12" dur="5.76">pressure and</text><text start="653.1" dur="5.64">um and yeah and and I&amp;#39;d probably rather</text><text start="656.88" dur="3.24">be the top player but</text><text start="658.74" dur="3.599">um but I&amp;#39;m also smaller right I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="660.12" dur="5.52">I&amp;#39;m not like a a heavyweight guy right</text><text start="662.339" dur="5.101">so from that perspective I think like</text><text start="665.64" dur="2.879">you know it&amp;#39;s especially because you</text><text start="667.44" dur="2.76">know from doing a competition I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="668.519" dur="3.301">compete with people who are my size but</text><text start="670.2" dur="2.819">a lot of my friends are bigger than me</text><text start="671.82" dur="2.759">so</text><text start="673.019" dur="2.76">um so back takes probably pretty</text><text start="674.579" dur="3.061">important right because that&amp;#39;s where you</text><text start="675.779" dur="2.941">have the most leverage Advantage right</text><text start="677.64" dur="3">where where</text><text start="678.72" dur="3.78">um you know people you know their arms</text><text start="680.64" dur="2.939">your arms are very weak behind you right</text><text start="682.5" dur="2.459">so</text><text start="683.579" dur="3.541">um so being able to get to the back and</text><text start="684.959" dur="3">and take that pretty important but I</text><text start="687.12" dur="2.58">don&amp;#39;t know I feel like the right</text><text start="687.959" dur="3.901">strategy is to not be too committed to</text><text start="689.7" dur="4.74">any single submission but that said I</text><text start="691.86" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t like hurting people so</text><text start="694.44" dur="5.16">um so I always think that chokes are are</text><text start="697.32" dur="4.56">a somewhat more human way to go than</text><text start="699.6" dur="4.919">than joint locks yeah and it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="701.88" dur="4.74">about control it&amp;#39;s less Dynamic so</text><text start="704.519" dur="3.961">you&amp;#39;re basically like a Habib numbering</text><text start="706.62" dur="3.839">a Madoff type of fighter so so let&amp;#39;s go</text><text start="708.48" dur="3.72">yeah a back take to a rear naked choke I</text><text start="710.459" dur="3.301">think it&amp;#39;s like the clean the clean way</text><text start="712.2" dur="4.5">to go straightforward answer right there</text><text start="713.76" dur="4.86">what advice would you give to um to</text><text start="716.7" dur="5.46">people looking to start learning Jiu</text><text start="718.62" dur="5.52">Jitsu given how busy you are given where</text><text start="722.16" dur="3.54">you are in life that you&amp;#39;re able to do</text><text start="724.14" dur="4.319">this you&amp;#39;re able to train you&amp;#39;re able to</text><text start="725.7" dur="4.86">compete and get uh to learn something</text><text start="728.459" dur="3.601">from this interesting art</text><text start="730.56" dur="4.019">why&amp;#39;d you think you have to be willing</text><text start="732.06" dur="5.459">to um</text><text start="734.579" dur="4.681">to just get beaten up a lot yeah I mean</text><text start="737.519" dur="3.241">but I mean over time I think that</text><text start="739.26" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a flow to all these</text><text start="740.76" dur="5.1">things and there&amp;#39;s um you know</text><text start="743.64" dur="5.4">one of the</text><text start="745.86" dur="5.34">one of I don&amp;#39;t know my experiences that</text><text start="749.04" dur="4.38">I think kind of transcends you know</text><text start="751.2" dur="3.66">running a company in the different</text><text start="753.42" dur="3.659">different activities that I like doing</text><text start="754.86" dur="3.9">or I I really believe that like if</text><text start="757.079" dur="4.561">you&amp;#39;re going to accomplish whatever</text><text start="758.76" dur="5.04">anything a lot of it is just being</text><text start="761.64" dur="5.34">willing to push through right and having</text><text start="763.8" dur="5.219">the grit and determination to to to push</text><text start="766.98" dur="4.38">through difficult situations</text><text start="769.019" dur="4.5">um I think for a lot of people that</text><text start="771.36" dur="4.02">um that ends up being sort of a</text><text start="773.519" dur="4.201">Difference Maker between the people you</text><text start="775.38" dur="3.6">know who who kind of get the most done</text><text start="777.72" dur="3.179">and not I mean there&amp;#39;s all these</text><text start="778.98" dur="3.96">questions about like</text><text start="780.899" dur="3.18">um you know how how many days people</text><text start="782.94" dur="2.699">want to work and things like that I</text><text start="784.079" dur="3.121">think almost all the people who like</text><text start="785.639" dur="3">start successful companies or things</text><text start="787.2" dur="3.36">like that are just are working extremely</text><text start="788.639" dur="3.961">hard but I think one of the things that</text><text start="790.56" dur="4.44">you learn both by you know doing this</text><text start="792.6" dur="6.479">over time or you know very acutely with</text><text start="795" dur="6.36">things like Jiu Jitsu or surfing is um</text><text start="799.079" dur="3.961">you can&amp;#39;t push through everything</text><text start="801.36" dur="3.84">and</text><text start="803.04" dur="4.739">I think that that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="805.2" dur="4.8">you you learn this stuff very acutely</text><text start="807.779" dur="4.381">you run doing sports compared to running</text><text start="810" dur="3.839">a company because running a company the</text><text start="812.16" dur="5.4">cycle times are so long right it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="813.839" dur="5.581">you start a project and then you know</text><text start="817.56" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s like months later or you know if</text><text start="819.42" dur="2.64">you&amp;#39;re building Hardware it could be</text><text start="820.8" dur="3.18">years later before you&amp;#39;re actually</text><text start="822.06" dur="3.3">getting feedback and able to you know</text><text start="823.98" dur="2.4">make the next set of decisions for the</text><text start="825.36" dur="2.82">next version of the thing that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="826.38" dur="3.959">doing whereas you one of the things that</text><text start="828.18" dur="5.099">I just think is mentally so nice about</text><text start="830.339" dur="5.401">these very high turnaround</text><text start="833.279" dur="4.201">conditioning Sports things like that is</text><text start="835.74" dur="3.599">you get feedback very quickly right it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="837.48" dur="3.18">like okay like I don&amp;#39;t counter something</text><text start="839.339" dur="3.18">correctly you get punched in the face</text><text start="840.66" dur="3.119">right so not in Jiu Jitsu you know you</text><text start="842.519" dur="2.281">don&amp;#39;t get punched in Jiu Jitsu but an</text><text start="843.779" dur="2.641">MMA</text><text start="844.8" dur="3.06">um there are all these analogies between</text><text start="846.42" dur="3.74">all these things that I think actually</text><text start="847.86" dur="4.919">hold that are that are like</text><text start="850.16" dur="5.56">important life lessons right it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="852.779" dur="6.541">okay you&amp;#39;re surfing a wave it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="855.72" dur="5.16">you know sometimes you&amp;#39;re like you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="859.32" dur="3.72">go in the other direction on it right</text><text start="860.88" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s like there are limits to kind of</text><text start="863.04" dur="4.08">what you know it&amp;#39;s like a foil you can</text><text start="865.079" dur="4.32">you can pump the foil and and push</text><text start="867.12" dur="3.959">pretty hard in a bunch of directions but</text><text start="869.399" dur="3.781">like yeah you you know it&amp;#39;s at some</text><text start="871.079" dur="4.081">level like the momentum against you is</text><text start="873.18" dur="4.56">is strong enough you&amp;#39;re that&amp;#39;s not gonna</text><text start="875.16" dur="6.539">work and and I do think that</text><text start="877.74" dur="6.839">um that&amp;#39;s sort of a a humbling but also</text><text start="881.699" dur="3.961">an important lesson for I think people</text><text start="884.579" dur="3.661">who are running things or building</text><text start="885.66" dur="4.14">things it&amp;#39;s like yeah you you um you</text><text start="888.24" dur="3.779">know a lot of the game is just being</text><text start="889.8" dur="4.2">able to kind of push and and and and</text><text start="892.019" dur="4.62">work through complicated things but you</text><text start="894" dur="4.079">also need to kind of have enough of an</text><text start="896.639" dur="4.081">understanding like which things you just</text><text start="898.079" dur="4.741">can&amp;#39;t push through and where where um</text><text start="900.72" dur="5.58">um the Finesse is more important yeah</text><text start="902.82" dur="6.12">what are your Jiu Jitsu life lessons</text><text start="906.3" dur="5.279">well I think you did it</text><text start="908.94" dur="5.1">you made it sound so simple</text><text start="911.579" dur="3.301">and we&amp;#39;re so eloquent that it&amp;#39;s easy to</text><text start="914.04" dur="5.46">miss</text><text start="914.88" dur="8.04">but basically being okay and accepting</text><text start="919.5" dur="4.98">the wisdom and the joy in the uh getting</text><text start="922.92" dur="4.32">your ass kicked</text><text start="924.48" dur="5.039">in the full range of what that means I</text><text start="927.24" dur="3.599">think that&amp;#39;s a big gift of the being</text><text start="929.519" dur="3.481">humbled</text><text start="930.839" dur="5.161">somehow being humbled especially</text><text start="933" dur="4.92">physically opens your mind to the the</text><text start="936" dur="4.74">full process of learning what it means</text><text start="937.92" dur="5.219">to learn which is being willing to suck</text><text start="940.74" dur="6.959">at something I think Jiu-Jitsu is just</text><text start="943.139" dur="6.841">very repetitively efficiently humbles</text><text start="947.699" dur="4.561">you over and over and over and over to</text><text start="949.98" dur="4.919">where you can carry that lessons to</text><text start="952.26" dur="4.56">places where you don&amp;#39;t get humbled as</text><text start="954.899" dur="4.141">much whether it&amp;#39;s research or running a</text><text start="956.82" dur="4.019">company or building stuff the the cycle</text><text start="959.04" dur="4.56">is longer and you just so you can just</text><text start="960.839" dur="4.44">get humbled in a period of an hour over</text><text start="963.6" dur="2.94">and over and over and over especially</text><text start="965.279" dur="2.521">when you&amp;#39;re a beginner you&amp;#39;ll have a</text><text start="966.54" dur="3.359">little person</text><text start="967.8" dur="7.5">just you know somebody much smarter than</text><text start="969.899" dur="7.5">you just kick your ass uh repeatedly uh</text><text start="975.3" dur="4.68">definitively where there&amp;#39;s no argument</text><text start="977.399" dur="4.44">oh yeah and then you you literally tap</text><text start="979.98" dur="4.52">because if you don&amp;#39;t tap you&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="981.839" dur="5.041">die so this is an agreement</text><text start="984.5" dur="3.579">you could have killed me just now but</text><text start="986.88" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re friends so you were going to agree</text><text start="988.079" dur="3.841">that you&amp;#39;re not going to and that kind</text><text start="990.06" dur="4.079">of humbling process it just does</text><text start="991.92" dur="4.02">something to your psyche to Your Ego</text><text start="994.139" dur="4.921">that puts it in its proper context to</text><text start="995.94" dur="6.12">realize that you know everything</text><text start="999.06" dur="7.079">in this life is like a journey from</text><text

after</text><text start="1010.82" dur="3.42">day like any kind of success requires</text><text start="1012.68" dur="3.3">hard work</text><text start="1014.24" dur="3.42">um yeah it&amp;#39;s just some more than a lot</text><text start="1015.98" dur="3.779">of sports I would say because I&amp;#39;ve done</text><text start="1017.66" dur="4.5">a lot of them it really teaches you that</text><text start="1019.759" dur="4.501">and you made it sound so simple like I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1022.16" dur="3.779">almost you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s part</text><text

said</text><text start="1037.699" dur="4.561">it in the very beginning which is that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1040.22" dur="3.599">the thing that stops US especially as</text><text start="1042.26"

dur="4.62">deal that we that we have is that you</text><text start="1156.74" dur="3.66">know we can get you know if you&amp;#39;re one</text><text start="1158.96" dur="3.06">of the top AI researchers

dur="5.26">infrastructure and and and part of our</text><text start="1166.94" dur="4.14">ethos is that we we want to share what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1169.4" dur="3.84">what&amp;#39;s invented</text><text start="1171.08" dur="4.04">um broadly we do that with a lot of the</text><text start="1173.24" dur="4.86">the different AI tools that we create</text><text start="1175.12" dur="5.799">and llama is the language model that</text><text start="1178.1" dur="5.64">that our research team made and</text><text start="1180.919" dur="4.921">you know we we did in a limited</text><text start="1183.74" dur="4.38">um a limited open source release for it</text><text start="1185.84" dur="4.5">right where which was intended for</text><text start="1188.12" dur="2.88">researchers to be able to use it</text><text start="1190.34" dur="3.42">um</text><text start="1191" dur="5.76">but you know responsibility and getting</text><text start="1193.76" dur="5.34">safety right on these is um is very</text><text start="1196.76" dur="3.9">important so we didn&amp;#39;t think that</text><text start="1199.1" dur="3.6">for the first one there were a bunch of</text><text start="1200.66" dur="4.68">questions around whether we should be</text><text start="1202.7" dur="4.68">releasing this commercially so we kind</text><text start="1205.34" dur="3.959">of punched it on that for for V1 of of</text><text start="1207.38" dur="4.08">llama and and just released it from</text><text start="1209.299" dur="3.601">research now obviously by releasing it</text><text start="1211.46" dur="3.06">for research</text><text start="1212.9" dur="3.24">um you know it&amp;#39;s out there but but</text><text start="1214.52" dur="2.82">companies know that that they&amp;#39;re that</text><text start="1216.14" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re not supposed to kind of put it</text><text start="1217.34" dur="5.04">into commercial releases and um you know</text><text start="1220.039" dur="3.961">we&amp;#39;re working on the follow-up models</text><text start="1222.38" dur="4.98">for this and and thinking through how</text><text start="1224" dur="4.919">how um what what the the how exactly</text><text start="1227.36" dur="3.48">this should work for for follow-on now</text><text start="1228.919" dur="3.841">that we&amp;#39;ve had time to to work on a lot</text><text start="1230.84" dur="3.719">more of the the safety and</text><text start="1232.76" dur="4.14">um and the pieces around that but but</text><text start="1234.559" dur="6">overall I mean this is</text><text start="1236.9" dur="5.76">I just kind of think that</text><text start="1240.559" dur="5.461">that it would be good</text><text start="1242.66" dur="6.54">if there were a lot of different folks</text><text start="1246.02" dur="5.82">who had the ability to build state of</text><text start="1249.2" dur="5.28">the art technology here</text><text start="1251.84" dur="4.98">you know it&amp;#39;s and not just a small</text><text start="1254.48" dur="4.439">number of of big companies we&amp;#39;re to</text><text start="1256.82" dur="5.46">train one of these AI models the</text><text start="1258.919" dur="5.281">state-of-the-art models is um it just</text><text start="1262.28" dur="3.96">takes you know hundreds of millions of</text><text start="1264.2" dur="4.979">dollars of infrastructure right so there</text><text start="1266.24" dur="4.14">are not that many organizations in the</text><text start="1269.179" dur="3">world</text><text start="1270.38" dur="4.98">um that can do that at the biggest scale</text><text start="1272.179" dur="5.341">today and no it gets it gets more</text><text start="1275.36" dur="4.26">efficient every day so</text><text start="1277.52" dur="3.72">um so I I do think that that will be</text><text start="1279.62" dur="3.12">available to more folks over time but</text><text start="1281.24" dur="2.939">but I just think like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1282.74" dur="4.14">all this Innovation out there that</text><text start="1284.179" dur="4.5">people can create and um</text><text start="1286.88" dur="4.56">and and I I just think that will will</text><text start="1288.679" dur="5.521">also learn a lot by by seeing what the</text><text start="1291.44" dur="4.859">whole community of students and</text><text start="1294.2" dur="3.599">um and hackers and startups and</text><text start="1296.299" dur="2.821">different folks</text><text start="1297.799" dur="2.521">um build with this and that&amp;#39;s kind of</text><text start="1299.12" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s kind of been how we&amp;#39;ve approached</text><text start="1300.32" dur="3.54">this and it&amp;#39;s also we&amp;#39;ve done a lot of</text><text start="1302.36" dur="3.54">our infrastructure and we took our whole</text><text start="1303.86" dur="3.9">data center design and our server design</text><text start="1305.9" dur="3.18">and we we built this open compute</text><text start="1307.76" dur="2.58">project where we just made that public</text><text start="1309.08" dur="2.82">and</text><text start="1310.34" dur="2.88">um part of the theory was like all right</text><text start="1311.9" dur="5.34">if we make it&amp;#39;s that more people can use</text><text start="1313.22" dur="5.579">this server design then um then that&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="1317.24" dur="3.24">enable more Innovation it&amp;#39;ll also make</text><text start="1318.799" dur="3.36">the server design more efficient and</text><text start="1320.48" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;ll that&amp;#39;ll make our business more</text><text start="1322.159" dur="2.88">efficient too so that&amp;#39;s worked and we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1323.6" dur="2.819">we&amp;#39;ve just done this with a lot of our</text><text start="1325.039" dur="3.361">our infrastructure</text><text start="1326.419" dur="3.901">so for people who don&amp;#39;t know you did the</text><text start="1328.4" dur="4.08">limited release I think in February of</text><text start="1330.32" dur="6.18">one of this year of llama</text><text start="1332.48" dur="6.72">and it got quote unquote leaked</text><text start="1336.5" dur="4.32">meaning like it&amp;#39;s uh</text><text start="1339.2" dur="4.62">escaped</text><text start="1340.82" dur="4.56">the uh the the limited release aspect</text><text start="1343.82" dur="3.42">but it was</text><text start="1345.38" dur="3.72">you know that something you probably</text><text start="1347.24" dur="3.66">anticipated given that it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="1349.1" dur="4.38">released we shared it with researchers</text><text start="1350.9" dur="6.06">right so it&amp;#39;s just trying to make sure</text><text start="1353.48" dur="5.22">that there&amp;#39;s like a slow release yeah uh</text><text start="1356.96" dur="3.24">but from there I just would love to get</text><text start="1358.7" dur="3.359">your comment on what happened next which</text><text start="1360.2" dur="3.359">is like this is a very vibrant open</text><text start="1362.059" dur="5.061">source community that just builds stuff</text><text start="1363.559" dur="5.641">on top of it there&amp;#39;s uh llama CPP</text><text start="1367.12" dur="4.72">basically stuff that makes it more</text><text start="1369.2" dur="5.58">efficient to run on smaller computers uh</text><text start="1371.84" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s combining with uh reinforcement</text><text start="1374.78" dur="3.899">learning with human feedback so some of</text><text start="1376.94" dur="3.54">the different interesting fine-tuning</text><text start="1378.679" dur="3.781">mechanisms there&amp;#39;s then also like</text><text start="1380.48" dur="5.52">fine-tuning and a GPT three generations</text><text start="1382.46" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s a lot of uh GPT for all alpaca</text><text start="1386" dur="4.38">uh colossal AI all these kinds of models</text><text start="1388.46" dur="4.14">just kind of spring up like</text><text start="1390.38" dur="3.6">run on top of wood yeah like what do you</text><text start="1392.6" dur="3.6">think about that no I think it&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="1393.98" dur="4.679">really neat to see I mean there&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="1396.2" dur="4.08">folks who are getting it to run on local</text><text start="1398.659" dur="3.981">devices right so if you&amp;#39;re an individual</text><text start="1400.28" dur="4.62">who just you know wants to experiment</text><text start="1402.64" dur="3.88">you know with this at home</text><text start="1404.9" dur="4.139">you probably don&amp;#39;t have a large budget</text><text start="1406.52" dur="3.899">to get access to like a large amount of</text><text start="1409.039" dur="3.661">cloud compute so getting it to run on</text><text start="1410.419" dur="4.441">your local laptop</text><text start="1412.7" dur="4.38">um you know is is uh is pretty good</text><text start="1414.86" dur="3.6">right and pretty relevant</text><text start="1417.08" dur="3.719">um and then there are things like yeah</text><text start="1418.46" dur="4.5">llama CPP</text><text start="1420.799" dur="3.781">um re-implemented it more efficiently so</text><text start="1422.96" dur="3.9">you know now even when we run our own</text><text start="1424.58" dur="4.26">versions of it we can do it on way less</text><text start="1426.86" dur="3.48">compute and it just way more efficient</text><text start="1428.84" dur="3.36">save a lot of money</text><text start="1430.34" dur="4.319">um for everyone who uses this so that</text><text start="1432.2" dur="3.479">that is is is good</text><text start="1434.659" dur="4.441">um</text><text start="1435.679" dur="5.341">I do think it&amp;#39;s worth calling out that</text><text start="1439.1" dur="3.66">because this was a relatively early</text><text start="1441.02" dur="2.34">release</text><text start="1442.76" dur="5.039">um</text><text start="1443.36" dur="7.319">llama isn&amp;#39;t quite as on the frontier as</text><text start="1447.799" dur="5.88">for example the biggest open AI models</text><text start="1450.679" dur="5.701">or the biggest Google models right when</text><text start="1453.679" dur="4.561">you mentioned that the largest llama</text><text start="1456.38" dur="5.279">model that we released had 65 billion</text><text start="1458.24" dur="6.84">parameters and when no one knows you</text><text start="1461.659" dur="6.241">know I guess outside of open AI exactly</text><text start="1465.08" dur="4.56">what the specs are for um for for gpd4</text><text start="1467.9" dur="3.54">but but I I think the you know my</text><text start="1469.64" dur="4.2">understanding is it&amp;#39;s like 10 times</text><text start="1471.44" dur="4.739">bigger and I think Google&amp;#39;s Palm model</text><text start="1473.84" dur="4.319">is is also I think has about 10 times as</text><text start="1476.179" dur="3.901">many parameters now the Llama models are</text><text start="1478.159" dur="3.721">very efficient so they perform well for</text><text start="1480.08" dur="4.02">for something that&amp;#39;s around 65 billion</text><text start="1481.88" dur="3.72">parameters so for me that was also part</text><text start="1484.1" dur="4.26">of this because there&amp;#39;s this whole</text><text start="1485.6" dur="6.84">debate around you know is it good for</text><text start="1488.36" dur="8.1">everyone in the world to have access to</text><text start="1492.44" dur="7.08">um to the most Frontier AI models and I</text><text start="1496.46" dur="5.76">I think as the AI models start</text><text start="1499.52" dur="4.98">approaching something that&amp;#39;s like a</text><text start="1502.22" dur="3.66">super human intelligent sense like that</text><text start="1504.5" dur="2.7">that&amp;#39;s a bigger question that we&amp;#39;ll have</text><text start="1505.88" dur="4.5">to Grapple with but right now I mean</text><text start="1507.2" dur="5.219">these are still you know very basic</text><text start="1510.38" dur="3.96">tools they&amp;#39;re um you know they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1512.419" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re powerful in the sense that you</text><text start="1514.34" dur="4.62">know a lot of Open Source software like</text><text start="1515.78" dur="5.759">databases or web servers can enable a</text><text start="1518.96" dur="4.32">lot of pretty important things</text><text start="1521.539" dur="3.721">um but</text><text start="1523.28" dur="4.499">I don&amp;#39;t think anyone looks at the the</text><text start="1525.26" dur="4.08">you know the current generation of llama</text><text start="1527.779" dur="3.301">and thinks it&amp;#39;s um you know anywhere</text><text start="1529.34" dur="2.88">near a super intelligence so I think</text><text start="1531.08" dur="3.839">that a bunch of those questions around</text><text start="1532.22" dur="5.459">like is it is it good to to kind of get</text><text start="1534.919" dur="5.161">out there I think at this stage surely</text><text start="1537.679" dur="4.321">you you want more researchers working on</text><text start="1540.08" dur="3.959">it for all the reasons that</text><text start="1542" dur="3.059">um that open source software has a lot</text><text start="1544.039" dur="2.64">of advantages and we talked about</text><text start="1545.059" dur="3.6">efficiency before but another one is</text><text start="1546.679" dur="4.021">just open source software tends to be</text><text start="1548.659" dur="4.5">more secure because you have more people</text><text start="1550.7" dur="5.04">looking at it openly and scrutinizing it</text><text start="1553.159" dur="4.26">and finding holes in it</text><text start="1555.74" dur="3.419">um and that makes it more safe so I</text><text start="1557.419" dur="5.101">think at this point it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="1559.159" dur="5.701">I think it&amp;#39;s generally agreed upon that</text><text start="1562.52" dur="4.139">open source software is generally more</text><text start="1564.86" dur="3.059">secure and safer</text><text start="1566.659" dur="2.941">um than things that are kind of</text><text start="1567.919" dur="3.36">developed in a silo where people try to</text><text start="1569.6" dur="4.86">get through security through obscurity</text><text start="1571.279" dur="4.981">so I think that for the scale of of what</text><text start="1574.46" dur="4.079">we&amp;#39;re seeing now with AI</text><text start="1576.26" dur="4.799">I think we&amp;#39;re more likely to get to you</text><text start="1578.539" dur="4.5">know good alignment and good</text><text start="1581.059" dur="3.961">um understanding of of kind of what</text><text start="1583.039" dur="3.661">needs to do to make this work well by</text><text start="1585.02" dur="3.3">having it be open source and and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1586.7" dur="3.24">something that I think is is quite good</text><text start="1588.32" dur="3.599">to have out there and and happening</text><text start="1589.94" dur="5.46">publicly at this point meta released a</text><text start="1591.919" dur="7.941">lot of models as open source so uh the</text><text start="1595.4" dur="4.46">Massillon multi-lingual speech model</text><text start="1600.279" dur="3.52">I&amp;#39;ll ask you questions about those but</text><text start="1602.299" dur="3.901">the point is</text><text start="1603.799" dur="3.661">uh you&amp;#39;ve open source quite a lot you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1606.2" dur="3.54">been spearheading the open source</text><text start="1607.46" dur="4.56">movement where&amp;#39;s uh that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="1609.74" dur="3.66">positive inspiring to see from one angle</text><text start="1612.02" dur="3.24">from the research angle of course</text><text start="1613.4" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s folks who are really terrified</text><text start="1615.26" dur="4.08">about the existential threat of</text><text start="1617.12" dur="5.22">artificial intelligence and those folks</text><text start="1619.34" dur="4.86">will say that you know</text><text start="1622.34" dur="5.28">um you have to be careful about the open</text><text start="1624.2" dur="5.64">sourcing uh step but where do you see</text><text start="1627.62" dur="6.659">the future of Open Source here uh as</text><text start="1629.84" dur="6.54">part of meta the tension here is do you</text><text start="1634.279" dur="3">want to release the magic sauce that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1636.38" dur="4.02">one</text><text start="1637.279" dur="5.52">tension and the other one is uh do you</text><text start="1640.4" dur="5.759">want to put a powerful tool in the hands</text><text start="1642.799" dur="4.98">of uh Bad actors even though it probably</text><text start="1646.159" dur="2.88">has a huge amount of positive impact</text><text start="1647.779" dur="2.701">also</text><text start="1649.039" dur="2.941">yeah I mean again</text><text start="1650.48" dur="3.72">stage that we&amp;#39;re at in the development</text><text start="1651.98" dur="3.9">of AI I don&amp;#39;t think anyone looks at the</text><text

we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1660.14" dur="5.279">talking about for the Llama models here</text><text start="1662.96" dur="4.319">are you know generally an order of</text><text start="1665.419" dur="3.481">magnitude smaller than what open AI or</text><text start="1667.279" dur="3.9">Google are doing so</text><text start="1668.9" dur="4.8">I think that at least for the stage that</text><text start="1671.179" dur="5.161">we&amp;#39;re at now the equities</text><text start="1673.7" dur="4.56">balance strongly in my view towards</text><text start="1676.34" dur="3.719">doing this more openly</text><text start="1678.26" dur="5.159">um I think if you got something that was</text><text start="1680.059" dur="5.1">closer to Super intelligence then I</text><text start="1683.419" dur="3.901">think you&amp;#39;d have to discuss that more</text><text start="1685.159" dur="3.841">and and think through that</text><text start="1687.32" dur="3.42">um a lot more and we

dur="2.88">so</text><text start="1696.38" dur="3.779">um so</text><text start="1697.82" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="1700.159" dur="4.62">uh I&amp;#39;m certainly not saying that the</text><text start="1702.38" dur="4.26">position that we&amp;#39;re taking on this now</text><text start="1704.779" dur="3.481">applies to every single thing that we</text><text start="1706.64" dur="3.36">would ever do and you know certainly</text><text start="1708.26" dur="3.539">inside the company and we probably do</text><text start="1710" dur="3.299">more open source work than</text><text start="1711.799" dur="3.661">you know most of the other big tech</text><text start="1713.299" dur="4.62">companies but we also don&amp;#39;t open source</text><text start="1715.46" dur="5.4">everything and a lot of our the core</text><text start="1717.919" dur="4.38">kind of app code for WhatsApp or</text><text start="1720.86" dur="3.419">Instagram or something I mean we&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="1722.299" dur="3.721">open sourcing that it&amp;#39;s not like a a</text><text start="1724.279" dur="3.421">general enough piece of software that</text><text start="1726.02" dur="3.72">would be useful for a lot of people to</text><text start="1727.7" dur="3.74">do different things</text><text start="1729.74" dur="4.2">um you know whereas</text><text start="1731.44" dur="5.8">the software that we do whether it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1733.94" dur="5.4">like a an open source server design or</text><text start="1737.24" dur="4.5">um or basically you know things like</text><text start="1739.34" dur="4.86">memcache right like a good you know it</text><text start="1741.74" dur="4.02">was probably our earliest project</text><text start="1744.2" dur="3.06">um that I worked on it was probably one</text><text start="1745.76" dur="4.26">of the last things that I that I coded</text><text start="1747.26" dur="5.399">and and led directly for the company</text><text start="1750.02" dur="4.259">um but but basically this like caching</text><text start="1752.659" dur="4.081">tool</text><text start="1754.279" dur="4.201">um for for quick data retrieval</text><text start="1756.74" dur="4.799">um these are things that are just</text><text start="1758.48" dur="4.86">broadly useful across like anything that</text><text start="1761.539" dur="2.88">you want to build and and I think that</text><text start="1763.34" dur="3.959">some of the</text><text start="1764.419" dur="3.901">language models now have that feel as</text><text start="1767.299" dur="2.521">well as some of the other things that</text><text start="1768.32" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re building like the translation tool</text><text start="1769.82" dur="5.099">that that you just referenced so text to</text><text start="1772.46" dur="4.199">speech and speech to text you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1774.919" dur="4.321">expanded it from around 100 languages to</text><text start="1776.659" dur="4.321">more than 1100 languages yeah and you</text><text start="1779.24" dur="3.12">can identify more than the model can</text><text start="1780.98" dur="4.079">identify more than</text><text start="1782.36" dur="4.52">4 000 spoken languages which is 40 times</text><text start="1785.059" dur="4.98">more than any known previous technology</text><text start="1786.88" dur="5.62">to me that&amp;#39;s really really exciting in</text><text start="1790.039" dur="4.921">terms of connecting the world breaking</text><text start="1792.5" dur="3.6">down barriers that language creates yeah</text><text start="1794.96" dur="2.819">I think being able to translate between</text><text start="1796.1" dur="6">all of these different</text><text start="1797.779" dur="9.181">pieces in real time this has been a</text><text start="1802.1" dur="6.66">kind of common sci-fi idea that we&amp;#39;d all</text><text

in real time</text><text start="1813.86" dur="2.699">um between all these different languages</text><text start="1815.179" dur="5.281">and that&amp;#39;s one that I think technology</text><text start="1816.559" dur="4.921">is basically delivering now so I think</text><text start="1820.46" dur="3.599">yeah I think that&amp;#39;s pretty pretty</text><text start="1821.48" dur="4.319">exciting uh you mentioned the next</text><text start="1824.059" dur="3.661">version of llama what can you say about</text><text start="1825.799" dur="4.74">the next version of llama</text><text start="1827.72" dur="4.319">what what can you say about like what uh</text><text start="1830.539" dur="3.901">what were you working on in terms of</text><text start="1832.039" dur="5.461">release in terms of the vision for that</text><text start="1834.44" dur="5.58">well a lot of what we&amp;#39;re doing is taking</text><text start="1837.5" dur="5.159">the first version which was primarily</text><text start="1840.02" dur="6.92">you know this research version and</text><text start="1842.659" dur="6.721">trying to now build a version that has</text><text start="1846.94" dur="5.26">all of the latest state-of-the-art</text><text start="1849.38" dur="4.799">safety precautions built in</text><text start="1852.2" dur="3.599">um and and we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1854.179" dur="5.461">um we&amp;#39;re using some more data to train</text><text start="1855.799" dur="5.641">it from across our services but</text><text start="1859.64" dur="3.96">but a lot of the the work that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1861.44" dur="4.739">doing internally is really just focused</text><text start="1863.6" dur="4.199">on making sure that this is</text><text start="1866.179" dur="5.041">um you know as</text><text start="1867.799" dur="4.921">aligned and responsible as possible and</text><text start="1871.22" dur="3.66">you know we&amp;#39;re building a lot of our own</text><text start="1872.72" dur="4.439">you know we&amp;#39;re talking about kind of the</text><text start="1874.88" dur="2.94">open source infrastructure but you know</text><text start="1877.159" dur="2.221">the</text><text start="1877.82" dur="2.94">the main thing that we focus on building</text><text start="1879.38" dur="2.88">here are you know a lot of product</text><text start="1880.76" dur="3.779">experiences to help people connect and</text><text start="1882.26" dur="3.96">express themselves so yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna</text><text start="1884.539" dur="6">I&amp;#39;ve talked about a bunch of this stuff</text><text start="1886.22" dur="6.059">but um you&amp;#39;ll have an assistant that you</text><text start="1890.539" dur="3.421">can talk to in WhatsApp</text><text start="1892.279" dur="4.201">um you know I think I I think in the</text><text start="1893.96" dur="4.8">future every Creator will will have kind</text><text start="1896.48" dur="4.199">of an AI agent that can kind of act on</text><text start="1898.76" dur="3.96">their behalf that their fans can talk to</text><text start="1900.679" dur="4.98">I I want to get to the point where every</text><text

and customer support and</text><text start="1909.74" dur="5.22">things like that so they&amp;#39;re going to be</text><text start="1911.48" dur="5.64">all these different things and</text><text start="1914.96" dur="4.079">llama or the language model underlying</text><text start="1917.12" dur="3.9">this is is basically going to be the</text><text start="1919.039" dur="5.821">engine that powers that the reason to</text><text start="1921.02" dur="6.42">open source it is that um as we did with</text><text start="1924.86" dur="4.5">um with the the first version is that it</text><text start="1927.44" dur="4.32">uh</text><text start="1929.36" dur="4.98">basically it unlocks a lot of innovation</text><text start="1931.76" dur="5.1">in the ecosystem will make our products</text><text start="1934.34" dur="4.199">better as well and also gives us a lot</text><text start="1936.86" dur="3.539">of valuable feedback on security and</text><text start="1938.539" dur="4.201">safety which is important for making</text><text start="1940.399" dur="3.841">this good but yeah I mean the the work</text><text start="1942.74" dur="4.74">that we&amp;#39;re doing to advance the</text><text start="1944.24" dur="4.919">infrastructure it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s basically at</text><text start="1947.48" dur="3.9">this point taking it Beyond a research</text><text start="1949.159" dur="4.861">project into something which is ready to</text><text start="1951.38" dur="4.98">be kind of core infrastructure not only</text><text start="1954.02" dur="4.019">for our own products but</text><text start="1956.36" dur="3.299">um you know hopefully for for a lot of</text><text start="1958.039" dur="3.721">other things out there too do you think</text><text start="1959.659" dur="5.341">the Llama Or the language model</text><text start="1961.76" dur="5">underlying that version two will be open</text><text start="1965" dur="4.32">sourced</text><text start="1966.76" dur="5.26">you&amp;#39;re you have internal debate around</text><text start="1969.32" dur="3.959">that the pros and cons and so on this is</text><text start="1972.02" dur="3.72">I mean we were talking about the debates</text><text start="1973.279" dur="3.301">that we have internally and I think</text><text start="1975.74" dur="2.58">um</text><text start="1976.58" dur="4.38">I think the question is how to do it</text><text start="1978.32" dur="4.92">right I mean it&amp;#39;s I think we</text><text start="1980.96" dur="4.5">you know we did the research license for</text><text start="1983.24" dur="4.5">V1 and and I think the the big thing</text><text start="1985.46" dur="4.079">that we&amp;#39;re that we&amp;#39;re thinking about is</text><text start="1987.74" dur="4.319">is basically like what&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="1989.539" dur="4.26">right the right way so there was a leak</text><text start="1992.059" dur="4.021">that happened I don&amp;#39;t know if you can</text><text start="1993.799" dur="5.581">comment on it for V1 you know we</text><text start="1996.08" dur="5.88">released it as a research project</text><text start="1999.38" dur="5.279">um for researchers to be able to use but</text><text start="2001.96" dur="4.62">in doing so we put it out there so</text><text start="2004.659" dur="3.781">um you know we were very clear that</text><text start="2006.58" dur="3.06">anyone who uses the the code and the</text><text start="2008.44" dur="3.599">weights doesn&amp;#39;t have a commercial</text><text start="2009.64" dur="3.96">license to put into products and we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2012.039" dur="3.421">we&amp;#39;ve generally seen people respect that</text><text start="2013.6" dur="3.54">right it&amp;#39;s like you don&amp;#39;t have any</text><text start="2015.46" dur="3.959">reputable companies that are basically</text><text start="2017.14" dur="4.019">trying to put this into into</text><text start="2019.419" dur="3.781">um their commercial products but but</text><text start="2021.159" dur="4.321">yeah but by sharing it with you know so</text><text start="2023.2" dur="4.859">many researchers it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s you know yeah</text><text start="2025.48" dur="3.84">it did leave the building but uh what</text><text start="2028.059" dur="4.5">have you learned from that process that</text><text start="2029.32" dur="6.78">you might be able to apply to V2 about</text><text start="2032.559" dur="5.761">how to release it safely effectively uh</text><text start="2036.1" dur="3.84">if if you release it yeah well I mean I</text><text start="2038.32" dur="3.9">think a lot of the feedback like I said</text><text start="2039.94" dur="4.68">is just around you know different things</text><text start="2042.22" dur="4.799">around you know how do you fine-tune</text><text start="2044.62" dur="4.86">models to make them more aligned and</text><text start="2047.019" dur="4.38">safer and you see all the different data</text><text start="2049.48" dur="3.179">recipes that</text><text start="2051.399" dur="2.161">um you know you mentioned a lot of</text><text start="2052.659" dur="2.581">different</text><text start="2053.56" dur="3.539">projects that are based on this I mean</text><text start="2055.24" dur="4.619">there&amp;#39;s one at Berkeley there&amp;#39;s you know</text><text start="2057.099" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s just like all over and um</text><text start="2059.859" dur="3.24">and</text><text start="2061.839" dur="3">people have tried a lot of different</text><text start="2063.099" dur="4.26">things and we&amp;#39;ve tried a bunch of stuff</text><text start="2064.839" dur="5.34">internally so kind of where we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2067.359" dur="4.56">making progress here but also we&amp;#39;re able</text><text start="2070.179" dur="3.541">to learn from some of the best ideas in</text><text start="2071.919" dur="3.061">the community and you know I think it</text><text start="2073.72" dur="3.899">you know we want to just continue</text><text start="2074.98" dur="5.28">continue pushing that forward but I</text><text start="2077.619" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t have any news to announce um if</text><text start="2080.26" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2081.399" dur="4.98">asking I mean this is a a thing that</text><text start="2084.46" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re uh</text><text start="2086.379" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re still we&amp;#39;re still kind of you know</text><text start="2088.96" dur="4.679">actively working through the the right</text><text start="2091.419" dur="4.081">way to move forward here the details of</text><text start="2093.639" dur="5.041">the secret sauce are still being</text><text start="2095.5" dur="5.339">developed I see uh can you comment on</text><text start="2098.68" dur="3.96">what do you think of uh the thing that</text><text start="2100.839" dur="2.941">worked for gbt which is the</text><text start="2102.64" dur="4.02">reinforcement learning with human</text><text start="2103.78" dur="5.64">feedback so doing this alignment process</text><text start="2106.66" dur="4.199">do you find it interesting and as part</text><text start="2109.42" dur="4.32">of that let me ask because I talked to</text><text start="2110.859" dur="5.581">Jan lacun before talking to you today he</text><text start="2113.74" dur="4.08">asked me to ask or suggested that I ask</text><text start="2116.44" dur="3.84">do you think</text><text start="2117.82" dur="5.22">llm fine tuning will need to be</text><text start="2120.28" dur="5.94">crowdsourced Wikipedia Style</text><text start="2123.04" dur="6.78">so crowdsourcing so this kind of idea of</text><text start="2126.22" dur="7.08">how to integrate the human in the fine</text><text start="2129.82" dur="5.7">tuning of these Foundation models yeah I</text><text start="2133.3" dur="5.52">think that&amp;#39;s a really interesting idea</text><text start="2135.52" dur="4.5">that I&amp;#39;ve talked to Jan about a bunch</text><text start="2138.82" dur="2.46">um</text><text start="2140.02" dur="3">and</text><text start="2141.28" dur="4.44">we were talking about</text><text start="2143.02" dur="6.059">how do you basically train these models</text><text start="2145.72" dur="5.22">to be as as safe and aligned and</text><text start="2149.079" dur="3.061">responsible as possible and you know</text><text start="2150.94" dur="4.139">different groups out there who are doing</text><text start="2152.14" dur="6.959">development test different data recipes</text><text start="2155.079" dur="6.721">in fine tuning but this idea that you</text><text start="2159.099" dur="4.861">you just mentioned is</text><text start="2161.8" dur="3.84">that at the end of the day</text><text start="2163.96" dur="4.02">instead of having kind of one group</text><text start="2165.64" dur="4.68">fine-tune some stuff and another group</text><text start="2167.98" dur="3.78">you know produce a different fine-tuning</text><text start="2170.32" dur="3.06">recipe and then</text><text start="2171.76" dur="3.48">I was trying to figure out which one we</text><text start="2173.38" dur="3.6">think works best to produce the most</text><text start="2175.24" dur="2.82">aligned model</text><text start="2176.98" dur="2.879">um</text><text start="2178.06" dur="4.559">I I do think that</text><text start="2179.859" dur="5.401">it would be nice if you could get to a</text><text start="2182.619" dur="5.641">point where you had a Wikipedia style</text><text start="2185.26" dur="3">collaborative</text><text start="2188.32" dur="6.36">way for a kind of a broader Community to</text><text start="2192.46" dur="4.86">um to fine tune it as well now there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2194.68" dur="5.64">lot of challenges in that both from an</text><text start="2197.32" dur="4.799">infrastructure and like uh Community</text><text start="2200.32" dur="3.96">Management and product perspective

I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2208" dur="4.079">quite compelling and I think it it goes</text><text start="2210.04" dur="4.5">well with the ethos of open sourcing the</text><text start="2212.079" dur="5.161">technology is also finding a way to have</text><text start="2214.54" dur="3.299">a kind of Community Driven</text><text start="2217.24" dur="3.9">um</text><text start="2217.839" dur="4.74">a Community Driven training of it</text><text start="2221.14" dur="3.3">um but I think there are a lot of</text><text start="2222.579" dur="4.201">questions on this in general these this</text><text start="2224.44" dur="4.919">these questions around what&amp;#39;s the the</text><text start="2226.78" dur="5.819">best way to produce

as</text><text start="2234.64" dur="4.8">much progress on as the kind of core</text><text start="2236.68" dur="5.64">intelligence capability of the of the um</text><text start="2239.44" dur="4.26">the

start="2504.099" dur="4.321">because I think to some degree industry</text><text start="2505.9" dur="4.56">in the world needs some time to kind of</text><text start="2508.42" dur="3.48">build these

think there&amp;#39;s three main</text><text start="2591.16" dur="3.3">categories of things that we&amp;#39;re working</text><text start="2592.839" dur="3.621">on</text><text start="2594.46" dur="2">um</text><text start="2597.18" dur="5.919">the first that I think is probably the</text><text start="2601.48" dur="4.139">most interesting</text><text start="2603.099" dur="4.26">is um</text><text start="2605.619" dur="4.561">you know there&amp;#39;s this notion of like</text><text start="2607.359" dur="4.441">you&amp;#39;re gonna have an assistant or or an</text><text start="2610.18" dur="3.78">agent who you can talk to and I think</text><text start="2611.8" dur="4.019">probably the biggest thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2613.96" dur="5.04">different about my view of how this</text><text start="2615.819" dur="5.52">plays out from what I see with um with</text><text start="2619" dur="4.02">openai and Google and others is you know</text><text start="2621.339" dur="4.561">everyone else is building like</text><text start="2623.02" dur="5.819">the One Singular AI right it&amp;#39;s like okay</text><text start="2625.9" dur="5.64">you talk to chat GPT or you talk to Bard</text><text start="2628.839" dur="6.02">or you talk to Bing and</text><text start="2631.54" dur="3.319">my view is that</text><text start="2635.319" dur="3.841">that they&amp;#39;re going to be a lot of</text><text start="2637.48" dur="2.94">different AIS that people are going to</text><text start="2639.16" dur="2.699">want to engage with just like you want</text><text start="2640.42" dur="2.699">to use</text><text start="2641.859" dur="3.301">um you know a number of different apps</text><text start="2643.119" dur="3.48">for different things and you have</text><text start="2645.16" dur="3.3">relationships with different people in</text><text start="2646.599" dur="4.5">your life who feel different emotional</text><text start="2648.46" dur="6.06">roles for you</text><text start="2651.099" dur="5.401">um and I am</text><text start="2654.52" dur="3.78">so I think that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text><text start="2656.5" dur="2.76">people have a reason that they that I</text><text start="2658.3" dur="3.9">think you don&amp;#39;t just want like a</text><text start="2659.26" dur="4.62">singular Ai and that that I think is</text><text start="2662.2" dur="3.96">probably the biggest distinction in in</text><text start="2663.88" dur="3.66">terms of how I think about this and a</text><text start="2666.16" dur="3.24">bunch of these things I think you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="2667.54" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;ll want an assistant</text><text start="2669.4" dur="3">um I mean I mentioned a couple of these</text><text start="2670.72" dur="3.78">before I think like every Creator who</text><text start="2672.4" dur="5.82">you interact with will ultimately want</text><text start="2674.5" dur="5.339">some kind of AI that can proxy them and</text><text start="2678.22" dur="3.72">be something that their fans can</text><text start="2679.839" dur="4.441">interact with or that allows them to</text><text start="2681.94" dur="4.2">interact with their fans</text><text start="2684.28" dur="3.6">um this is like the common Creator</text><text start="2686.14" dur="3.6">promise everyone&amp;#39;s trying to build a</text><text start="2687.88" dur="3.239">community and engage with people and</text><text start="2689.74" dur="4.02">they want tools to be able to amplify</text><text start="2691.119" dur="4.681">themselves more and be able to do that</text><text start="2693.76" dur="5.52">um but</text><text start="2695.8" dur="5.58">but you only have 24 hours in a day so</text><text start="2699.28" dur="3.96">um so I think having the ability to</text><text start="2701.38" dur="3.959">basically like bottle up your</text><text start="2703.24" dur="4.68">personality and</text><text start="2705.339" dur="3.961">um or you know like give your fans</text><text start="2707.92" dur="3.24">information about when you&amp;#39;re performing</text><text start="2709.3" dur="3.18">a concert or something like that I mean</text><text start="2711.16" dur="2.699">that&amp;#39;s that I think is going to be</text><text start="2712.48" dur="3.24">something that&amp;#39;s super valuable but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2713.859" dur="3.301">not just that you know again it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="2715.72" dur="3.359">this idea that I think people are going</text><text start="2717.16" dur="3.419">to want Just One Singular AI I think</text><text start="2719.079" dur="2.461">you&amp;#39;re gonna You Know You&amp;#39;re Gonna Want</text><text start="2720.579" dur="2.881">to interact with a lot of different</text><text start="2721.54" dur="3.18">entities and then I think there&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="2723.46" dur="3.84">business version of this too which we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="2724.72" dur="3.379">touched on a couple of times which is</text><text start="2727.3" dur="3.059">um</text><text start="2728.099" dur="3.461">I think every business in the world is</text><text start="2730.359" dur="4.621">going to want</text><text start="2731.56" dur="5.7">basically an AI that that you know it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2734.98" dur="4.139">like you have your page on Instagram or</text><text start="2737.26" dur="4.079">Facebook or Whatsapp or whatever and you</text><text start="2739.119" dur="4.861">wanna you wanna Point people to</text><text start="2741.339" dur="3.961">an AI that people can interact with but</text><text start="2743.98" dur="2.52">you want to know that that AI is only</text><text start="2745.3" dur="2.64">going to sell your products you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2746.5" dur="3.3">want it you know recommending your</text><text start="2747.94" dur="4.2">competitors stuff right so so it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="2749.8" dur="5.1">like there can be like just uh you know</text><text start="2752.14" dur="4.74">One Singular AI that that can answer all</text><text start="2754.9" dur="3.9">the questions for a person because you</text><text start="2756.88" dur="3.239">know that ques like that I might not</text><text start="2758.8" dur="2.7">actually be aligned with you as a</text><text start="2760.119" dur="3.121">business to</text><text start="2761.5" dur="3.96">um to really just do the best job</text><text start="2763.24" dur="3.839">providing support for for your product</text><text start="2765.46" dur="3.42">so I think that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text><text start="2767.079" dur="4.74">clear need</text><text start="2768.88" dur="5.88">um in the market and in people&amp;#39;s lives</text><text start="2771.819" dur="5.881">for there to be a bunch of these part of</text><text start="2774.76" dur="4.8">that is figuring out the research the</text><text start="2777.7" dur="3.18">technology that enables the</text><text start="2779.56" dur="4.74">personalization that you&amp;#39;re talking</text><text start="2780.88" dur="6.84">about so not one centralized god-like</text><text start="2784.3" dur="5.76">llm but one just a huge diversity of</text><text start="2787.72" dur="4.34">them that&amp;#39;s fine-tuned to particular</text><text start="2790.06" dur="4.799">needs particular Styles particular</text><text start="2792.06" dur="4.72">businesses particular Brands all that</text><text start="2794.859" dur="3.72">kind of stuff and also enabling just</text><text start="2796.78" dur="4.5">enabling people to create them really</text><text start="2798.579" dur="4.441">easily for the you know for to for your</text><text start="2801.28" dur="3.66">own business or if you&amp;#39;re a Creator to</text><text start="2803.02" dur="4.44">be able to help you engage with your</text><text start="2804.94" dur="5.52">fans and I think that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2807.46" dur="4.44">um so yeah I think that there there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2810.46" dur="4.379">clear kind of interesting product</text><text start="2811.9" dur="5.52">Direction here that I think is fairly</text><text start="2814.839" dur="4.681">unique from from what in any of the</text><text start="2817.42" dur="3.84">other big companies there are taking</text><text start="2819.52" dur="3.42">um it also aligns well with this sort of</text><text start="2821.26" dur="4.04">Open Source approach because again we we</text><text start="2822.94" dur="4.98">sort of believe in this more</text><text start="2825.3" dur="4.9">community-oriented uh more

dur="4.381">implications of um of that approach</text><text start="2846.52" dur="2.64">being different from what others are</text><text start="2847.72" dur="3.06">taking</text><text start="2849.16"

dur="3.421">describe this it&amp;#39;s like I think we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="2878.98" dur="3.9">gonna have tools that are just way</text><text start="2881.02" dur="3.72">better than than what

off of advances</text><text start="2891.94" dur="3.899">in the same space</text><text start="2894.28" dur="2.64">um is there a lot of tools that I think</text><text start="2895.839" dur="2.881">are just going to get built into every</text><text start="2896.92" dur="4.26">one of our products I think every single</text><text start="2898.72" dur="4.02">thing that we do is gonna basically get</text><text start="2901.18" dur="3.659">evolved in this direction right it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2902.74" dur="5.339">like in the future if you&amp;#39;re advertising</text><text

start="2966.819" dur="4.441">it&amp;#39;s annoying and I think that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="2968.98" dur="3.839">kind of gives it a bad rap but</text><text start="2971.26" dur="3.059">um but yeah and a lot of the stuff is</text><text start="2972.819" dur="3.54">possible today I mean obviously a b</text><text start="2974.319" dur="4.141">testing stuff is built into a lot of</text><text start="2976.359" dur="3.96">these Frameworks the thing that&amp;#39;s new is</text><text start="2978.46" dur="3.78">having technology that can generate the</text><text start="2980.319" dur="3.601">ideas for about what to a B test</text><text start="2982.24" dur="3.18">something that that&amp;#39;s exciting so this</text><text start="2983.92" dur="3.179">will just be across

them and then it&amp;#39;ll create the</text><text start="2992.92" dur="5.76">code for you so the natural language</text><text start="2995.099" dur="5.561">becomes the the interface we use

yeah</text><text start="3004.92" dur="4.38">totally yeah which is what everyone can</text><text start="3007.5" dur="3.42">do using natural language and with</text><text start="3009.3" dur="3.72">translation you can do it any kind of</text><text start="3010.92" dur="4.32">language</text><text start="3013.02" dur="4.44">um I I mean for the personalization is</text><text start="3015.24" dur="5.099">really really really interesting</text><text start="3017.46" dur="4.92">yeah it unlocks so many possible things</text><text start="3020.339" dur="4.081">I mean I for one look forward to</text><text start="3022.38" dur="3.42">creating a copy of myself</text><text start="3024.42" dur="4.919">I know we talked about this last time</text><text start="3025.8" dur="5.64">but this has since the last time this</text><text start="3029.339" dur="4.5">becomes now we&amp;#39;re closer</text><text start="3031.44" dur="3.72">much closer like I could literally just</text><text start="3033.839" dur="3.48">haven&amp;#39;t interacted with some of these</text><text start="3035.16" dur="7.1">language models I could see the Absurd</text><text start="3037.319" dur="8.221">situation where I&amp;#39;ll have a uh large uh</text><text start="3042.26" dur="6.339">or a Lex language model and I&amp;#39;ll have to</text><text start="3045.54" dur="4.38">have a

dur="2.52">having a conversation where you</text><text start="3052.98" dur="3.3">fine-tune that thing to be a little bit</text><text start="3054.359" dur="5.581">more respectful or something like this I</text><text start="3056.28" dur="7.92">mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s going to be the</text><text start="3059.94" dur="8.1">that seems like an amazing product</text><text start="3064.2" dur="6.24">for businesses for humans just not not</text><text start="3068.04" dur="5.279">just the assistant that&amp;#39;s facing the</text><text start="3070.44" dur="4.58">individual but the

dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s basically a layer that is the AI</text><text start="3081.3" dur="5.58">system through which you interact with</text><text start="3084.66" dur="4.56">the outside world with the outside world</text><text start="3086.88" dur="5.64">that has humans in it that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="3089.22" dur="5.879">interesting and you that have social</text><text start="3092.52" dur="5.039">networks that connect billions of people</text><text start="3095.099" dur="5.581">it seems like a</text><text start="3097.559" dur="4.5">heck of a large scale place to test some</text><text start="3100.68" dur="2.82">of this stuff out</text><text start="3102.059" dur="3.841">yeah I mean I think part of the reason</text><text start="3103.5" dur="3.359">why creators will want to do this is</text><text start="3105.9" dur="3.24">because they already have the</text><text start="3106.859" dur="5.22">communities on our services</text><text start="3109.14" dur="4.5">yeah and and a lot of the interface for</text><text start="3112.079" dur="4.74">this stuff today</text><text start="3113.64" dur="5.459">are chat type interfaces and and between</text><text start="3116.819" dur="4.681">WhatsApp and and messenger I think that</text><text start="3119.099" dur="5.161">those are you know just great great ways</text><text start="3121.5" dur="5.4">to to interact with people so some of</text><text start="3124.26" dur="5.099">this is philosophy but do you see do you</text><text start="3126.9" dur="4.38">see any term future where you have some</text><text start="3129.359" dur="5.76">of the people you&amp;#39;re friends with</text><text start="3131.28" dur="7.26">our AI systems on these social networks</text><text start="3135.119" dur="5.761">on Facebook on Instagram even even on</text><text start="3138.54" dur="6">WhatsApp having having conversations</text><text start="3140.88" dur="6.78">where some heterogeneous some human some</text><text start="3144.54" dur="5.22">is AI I think we&amp;#39;ll get to that</text><text start="3147.66" dur="5.22">um you know and you know if only just</text><text start="3149.76" dur="5.04">empirically looking at</text><text start="3152.88" dur="4.62">then Microsoft released this thing</text><text start="3154.8" dur="6">called show ice several years ago in in</text><text start="3157.5" dur="5.78">China it was a pre-llm chatbot</text><text start="3160.8" dur="5.22">technology that it was a lot simpler</text><text start="3163.28" dur="4.48">than what&amp;#39;s possible today</text><text start="3166.02" dur="3.42">and I think there&amp;#39;s like tens of</text><text start="3167.76" dur="4.559">millions of people were using this and</text><text start="3169.44" dur="4.56">and just you know really it became quite</text><text start="3172.319" dur="2.941">attached and you know built</text><text start="3174" dur="2.579">relationships with it and I think that</text><text start="3175.26" dur="2.819">there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3176.579" dur="3.901">um you know there&amp;#39;s services today like</text><text start="3178.079" dur="4.321">replica where you know people are doing</text><text start="3180.48" dur="4.2">things like that and</text><text start="3182.4" dur="3.659">um so I I think that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3184.68" dur="4.2">certainly</text><text start="3186.059" dur="5.461">you know needs for companionship that</text><text start="3188.88" dur="3.38">people have you know older people</text><text start="3191.52" dur="4.559">um</text><text start="3192.26" dur="5.02">uh and it&amp;#39;s I I think most people I</text><text start="3196.079" dur="3.601">don&amp;#39;t have as many friends as they would</text><text start="3197.28" dur="3.839">like to have right if you look at</text><text start="3199.68" dur="3.179">um there&amp;#39;s some interesting demographic</text><text start="3201.119" dur="2.94">studies around</text><text start="3202.859" dur="3.601">like</text><text start="3204.059" dur="3.841">the average person has</text><text start="3206.46" dur="2.58">the number of close

mean</text><text start="3213.24" dur="3.839">that gets to like this is like the core</text><text start="3215.46" dur="3.84">thing that</text><text start="3217.079" dur="3.421">that I think about in terms of you know</text><text start="3219.3" dur="4.019">Building Services that help connect</text><text start="3220.5" dur="4.8">people so I think you&amp;#39;ll get tools that</text><text start="3223.319" dur="4.02">help people connect with each other are</text><text start="3225.3" dur="3.48">going to be you know the primary thing</text><text start="3227.339" dur="3.561">that we want to do</text><text start="3228.78" dur="4.44">um so you can imagine you know AI</text><text start="3230.9" dur="3.58">assistance that you know just do a</text><text start="3233.22" dur="2.58">better job of reminding you when it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3234.48" dur="2.879">your friend&amp;#39;s birthday and how you could</text><text start="3235.8" dur="3.24">celebrate them right it&amp;#39;s like right now</text><text start="3237.359" dur="3.48">we have like the little box in the</text><text start="3239.04" dur="3.299">corner of the website that tells you</text><text start="3240.839" dur="2.641">whose birthday it is and stuff like that</text><text start="3242.339" dur="3.24">but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3243.48" dur="3.96">um but you know at some level you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="3245.579" dur="3.54">just want to like send everyone a note</text><text start="3247.44" dur="4.679">that&amp;#39;s the same note saying happy</text><text start="3249.119" dur="5.581">birthday with an emoji right so having</text><text start="3252.119" dur="4.44">something that&amp;#39;s more of an you know a a</text><text start="3254.7" dur="4.26">social assistant in that sense and like</text><text start="3256.559" dur="4.981">that can you know update you on what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="3258.96" dur="4.859">going on in their

start="3269.339" dur="3.181">yeah beyond that</text><text start="3270.96" dur="4.32">um and there are all these different</text><text start="3272.52" dur="5.16">flavors of</text><text start="3275.28" dur="4.44">kind of personal AIS that I think could</text><text start="3277.68" dur="4.139">exist so I think an assistant is sort of</text><text start="3279.72" dur="4.32">the the kind of simplest one to wrap</text><text start="3281.819" dur="3.121">your head around but</text><text start="3284.04" dur="4.079">um</text><text start="3284.94" dur="5.399">like a mentor or a life coach</text><text

something like that and then you</text><text start="3302.579" dur="2.701">know all the way you can you might just</text><text start="3304.14" dur="3.3">go through a lot of the the different</text><text start="3305.28" dur="4.44">type of kind of functional</text><text start="3307.44" dur="4.26">relationships that people have in their</text><text start="3309.72" dur="3.06">life

start="3315.18" dur="2.76">these things so</text><text start="3316.92" dur="2.46">um I don&amp;#39;t know I think it&amp;#39;s part of the</text><text start="3317.94" dur="3.72">interesting Innovation that&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="3319.38" dur="3.479">exist is is that there there&amp;#39;s certainly</text><text start="3321.66" dur="3.72">a lot</text><text start="3322.859" dur="4.921">um like education tutors right it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="3325.38" dur="4.86">I just look at you know my kids</text><text start="3327.78" dur="3.42">learning to code and you know they love</text><text start="3330.24" dur="2.64">it</text><text start="3331.2" dur="3.119">um but you know it&amp;#39;s like they get stuck</text><text start="3332.88" dur="2.28">on a question and they have to wait till</text><text start="3334.319" dur="2.76">like</text><text start="3335.16" dur="3.959">I can help answer it right or someone</text><text start="3337.079" dur="3">else who they

think building a tool that can</text><text start="3534.9" dur="3.719">actually allow them to do that well is</text><text start="3536.4" dur="3.659">you know one simple thing that that I</text><text start="3538.619" dur="2.94">think is just like an interesting thing</text><text start="3540.059" dur="3.3">that that we&amp;#39;ve heard from a bunch of</text><text start="3541.559" dur="5.52">people that that they&amp;#39;d be interested in</text><text start="3543.359" dur="5.76">but I&amp;#39;m going back to the broader idea</text><text start="3547.079" dur="4.701">um</text><text start="3549.119" dur="4.621">I I don&amp;#39;t know I mean you know I just</text><text start="3551.78" dur="2.86">Priscilla and I just had our third</text><text start="3553.74"

it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="3565.98" dur="5.7">well because babies don&amp;#39;t generally have</text><text start="3568.5" dur="5.04">much capacity to tell you what they</text><text

dur="3.361">know my five-year-old daughter cries too</text><text start="3578.339" dur="4.441">because she sometimes has a hard time</text><text start="3579.96" dur="5.7">expressing you know what what

dur="2.821">actually a lot of adults get very</text><text start="3587.7" dur="3.899">frustrated too because they can&amp;#39;t they</text><text start="3589.44" dur="4.2">have a hard time expressing

start="3601.319" dur="4.321">the way so I don&amp;#39;t know I think that all</text><text start="3603.48" dur="4.859">these different technologies that can</text><text start="3605.64" dur="4.8">help us navigate the social complexity</text><text start="3608.339" dur="5.041">and actually be able to better express</text><text start="3610.44" dur="6.119">our what we&amp;#39;re feeling and thinking I</text><text start="3613.38" dur="4.739">think that&amp;#39;s generally all good and um</text><text start="3616.559" dur="2.941">there are always these concerns like</text><text start="3618.119" dur="2.94">okay are people gonna have worse</text><text start="3619.5" dur="3.839">memories because you have Google to look</text><text start="3621.059" dur="4.681">things up and and I think in general a</text><text start="3623.339" dur="4.561">generation later you don&amp;#39;t look back and</text><text start="3625.74" dur="3.72">lament that I think it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="3627.9" dur="3.48">like wow we have so much more capacity</text><text start="3629.46" dur="3.96">to to do so much more now and I think</text><text start="3631.38" dur="3.179">that that&amp;#39;ll be the case here too you</text><text start="3633.42" dur="4.919">can allocate those cognitive</text><text start="3634.559" dur="5.581">capabilities to like deeper like nuanced</text><text start="3638.339" dur="6.361">thought yeah</text><text start="3640.14" dur="7.159">uh yeah but it&amp;#39;s change so with with uh</text><text start="3644.7" dur="5.7">just like

basically don&amp;#39;t have to remember</text><text start="3653.119" dur="4.24">nearly as much</text><text start="3655.68" dur="3.54">just like with stack Overflow for</text><text start="3657.359"

creating narratives and</text><text start="4010.099" dur="6.421">controversy to me it&amp;#39;s kind of amazing</text><text start="4013.52" dur="4.92">how a small collection of yeah uh what</text><text start="4016.52" dur="3.9">did you say inauthentic accounts so it</text><text start="4018.44" dur="3.3">could be Bots but yeah I mean we have</text><text start="4020.42" dur="2.879">sort of this funny name for it but we</text><text start="4021.74" dur="3.66">call it coordinated and authentic</text><text start="4023.299" dur="4.081">Behavior yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text><text start="4025.4" dur="5.159">incredible how a small collection of</text><text start="4027.38" dur="4.5">folks can create narratives create</text><text start="4030.559" dur="4.441">stories</text><text start="4031.88" dur="5.159">yeah especially if they&amp;#39;re viral so if</text><text start="4035" dur="2.78">especially if they have a element they</text><text start="4037.039" dur="3.481">can</text><text start="4037.78" dur="4.779">catalyze the virality of the narrative</text><text start="4040.52" dur="3.779">yeah and I think there the question is</text><text start="4042.559" dur="3.721">you have to be</text><text start="4044.299" dur="3.961">I&amp;#39;m very specific about what is bad</text><text start="4046.28" dur="3.12">about it right because I think a set of</text><text start="4048.26" dur="2.88">people</text><text start="4049.4" dur="5.28">coming together</text><text start="4051.14" dur="6.3">or organically bouncing ideas off each</text><text start="4054.68" dur="4.919">other and a narrative comes out of that</text><text start="4057.44" dur="4.2">is not necessarily A Bad Thing by itself</text><text start="4059.599" dur="3.781">if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s kind of authentic and</text><text start="4061.64" dur="3.179">organic that&amp;#39;s like a lot of what</text><text start="4063.38" dur="2.82">happens and how culture gets created and</text><text start="4064.819" dur="2.941">how art gets created and a lot of good</text><text start="4066.2" dur="4.139">stuff so that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve kind of</text><text start="4067.76" dur="4.62">focused on this sense of coordinated and</text><text start="4070.339" dur="3.72">authentic Behavior so it&amp;#39;s like if you</text><text start="4072.38" dur="3.959">have a network of you know whether it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4074.059" dur="4.02">Bots some some people masquerading as</text><text start="4076.339" dur="2.341">different accounts</text><text start="4078.079" dur="2.941">um</text><text start="4078.68" dur="4.26">but you have kind of someone pulling the</text><text start="4081.02" dur="6.059">strings behind it</text><text start="4082.94" dur="5.94">um and trying to kind of act as if this</text><text start="4087.079" dur="3.061">is a more organic set of behavior but</text><text start="4088.88" dur="2.76">really it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s just like one</text><text start="4090.14" dur="3.479">coordinated thing</text><text start="4091.64" dur="3.36">that seems problematic to me right I</text><text start="4093.619" dur="3.961">mean I don&amp;#39;t think people should be able</text><text start="4095" dur="5.04">to have coordinated networks and not</text><text start="4097.58" dur="4.02">disclose it as such</text><text start="4100.04" dur="4.259">um but that again you know we&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="4101.6" dur="5.34">able to deploy pretty sophisticated Ai</text><text start="4104.299" dur="4.141">and you know counter-terrorism</text><text start="4106.94" dur="4.339">groups and things like that to be able</text><text start="4108.44" dur="5.759">to identify a fair number of these</text><text start="4111.279" dur="5.56">coordinated and authentic networks of</text><text start="4114.199" dur="4.681">accounts and and take them down</text><text start="4116.839" dur="4.081">um we continue to do that I think we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="4118.88" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ve you know so it&amp;#39;s one thing that if</text><text start="4120.92" dur="3.419">you told me 20 years ago it&amp;#39;s like all</text><text start="4122.48" dur="4.08">right you&amp;#39;re starting this website to</text><text start="4124.339" dur="3.301">help people

authentic I would have thought that</text><text start="4134.42" dur="4.919">was</text><text start="4135.199" dur="5.401">pretty wild but um but but it&amp;#39;s um but</text><text start="4139.339" dur="3.121">no I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s part of where</text><text start="4140.6" dur="4.199">we are but look I think that these</text><text start="4142.46" dur="4.259">questions that you&amp;#39;re pushing on now</text><text start="4144.799" dur="3.841">um</text><text start="4146.719" dur="4.08">this is actually where I guess most of</text><text start="4148.64" dur="4.5">the challenge around AI will be</text><text start="4150.799" dur="4.44">for the foreseeable future I think</text><text start="4153.14" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a lot of debate around things</text><text start="4155.239" dur="5.04">like is this going to create existential</text><text start="4157.64" dur="4.44">risk to humanity and I think that those</text><text start="4160.279" dur="4.741">are very hard things to disprove one way</text><text start="4162.08" dur="4.86">or another my own intuition is that the</text><text start="4165.02" dur="5.339">point at which we become close to super</text><text start="4166.94" dur="6.359">intelligent is super intelligence is</text><text start="4170.359" dur="4.44">um I I it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just really unclear to</text><text start="4173.299" dur="4.081">me that the current technology is gonna</text><text start="4174.799" dur="4.44">gonna get there without another set of</text><text start="4177.38" dur="3.12">of significant advances</text><text start="4179.239" dur="3.12">but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="4180.5" dur="4.5">danger I think the danger is basically</text><text start="4182.359" dur="5.761">amplifying the kind of known set of of</text><text start="4185" dur="4.62">harms that people or or sets of accounts</text><text start="4188.12" dur="3.659">can do and we just need to make sure</text><text start="4189.62" dur="2.82">that we really focus on</text><text start="4191.779" dur="2.641">um</text><text start="4192.44" dur="3.779">on on on basically doing that as well as</text><text start="4194.42" dur="3.779">possible so that that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4196.219" dur="4.02">definitely a big Focus for me well you</text><text start="4198.199" dur="3.54">can basically use large language models</text><text start="4200.239" dur="3.841">as an assistant</text><text start="4201.739" dur="4.681">of how to cause harm on social networks</text><text start="4204.08" dur="3.42">so you can ask it a question</text><text start="4206.42" dur="4.319">um</text><text start="4207.5" dur="6.06">you know meta has very impressive</text><text start="4210.739" dur="7.681">coordinated inauthentic account</text><text start="4213.56" dur="6.78">uh fighting capabilities how do I do the</text><text start="4218.42" dur="4.98">coordinating authentic account</text><text start="4220.34" dur="5.339">uh creation where meta doesn&amp;#39;t detect it</text><text start="4223.4" dur="4.339">like literally ask that question and</text><text start="4225.679" dur="5.04">they and basically there&amp;#39;s this kind of</text><text start="4227.739" dur="4.301">part of it I mean that&amp;#39;s what open AI</text><text start="4230.719" dur="3.48">showed that they&amp;#39;re concerned with those</text><text start="4232.04" dur="4.679">questions uh perhaps you can comment on</text><text start="4234.199" dur="5.04">your approach to it how to do</text><text start="4236.719" dur="4.801">kind of moderation on the output of</text><text start="4239.239" dur="4.44">those models that it can&amp;#39;t be used to</text><text start="4241.52" dur="4.38">help you coordinate harm</text><text start="4243.679" dur="4.261">in all the full definition of what the</text><text start="4245.9" dur="3.839">harm means yeah and that&amp;#39;s a lot of the</text><text start="4247.94" dur="3.18">fine-tuning and the the alignment</text><text start="4249.739" dur="4.44">training that we do</text><text start="4251.12" dur="5.18">is basically you know when we when we</text><text start="4254.179" dur="5.221">ship</text><text start="4256.3" dur="4.54">ai&amp;#39;s across the our products a lot of</text><text start="4259.4" dur="5.279">what we&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="4260.84" dur="7.62">make sure is that if you can&amp;#39;t ask it to</text><text start="4264.679" dur="6.361">help you commit a crime right it&amp;#39;s um</text><text start="4268.46" dur="4.86">uh</text><text start="4271.04" dur="3.42">so I think training it to kind of</text><text start="4273.32" dur="3.54">understand that</text><text start="4274.46" dur="4.08">and it&amp;#39;s not that not like any of these</text><text start="4276.86" dur="3.839">systems are ever going to be 100 perfect</text><text start="4278.54" dur="4.86">but</text><text start="4280.699" dur="7.261">you know just making it so that</text><text start="4283.4" dur="6.48">this isn&amp;#39;t a an easier way to go about</text><text start="4287.96" dur="4.14">doing something bad</text><text start="4289.88" dur="3.9">then the next best alternative right I</text><text start="4292.1" dur="3.84">mean people still have Google right you</text><text start="4293.78" dur="4.98">know you still have search engines so</text><text start="4295.94" dur="4.2">um the information is is out there</text><text start="4298.76" dur="3.3">um and</text><text start="4300.14" dur="3.66">now for for these</text><text start="4302.06" dur="3.96">you know what we see is like for nation</text><text start="4303.8" dur="4.439">states or you know these actors that are</text><text start="4306.02" dur="3.84">trying to pull off these large</text><text start="4308.239" dur="3.721">you know coordinated and authentic</text><text start="4309.86" dur="4.26">networks to to kind of influence</text><text start="4311.96" dur="3.9">different things at some point when we</text><text start="4314.12" dur="3">just make it very difficult they do just</text><text start="4315.86" dur="3.6">you know try to use other services</text><text start="4317.12" dur="4.92">instead right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like if you</text><text start="4319.46" dur="3.84">can make it more expensive for</text><text start="4322.04" dur="3.84">um for them to do it on your service</text><text start="4323.3" dur="4.8">then then kind of people go go elsewhere</text><text start="4325.88" dur="4.319">and I think that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the bar</text><text start="4328.1" dur="3.9">right it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not like okay are</text><text start="4330.199" dur="3.841">you ever going to be perfect at finding</text><text start="4332" dur="3.96">you know every adversary who tries to</text><text start="4334.04" dur="3.84">attack you it&amp;#39;s I mean you try to get as</text><text start="4335.96" dur="3.66">close to that as possible but</text><text start="4337.88" dur="3.06">um but I think really kind of</text><text start="4339.62" dur="2.7">economically we&amp;#39;re just trying to do is</text><text start="4340.94" dur="3.36">make it that it&amp;#39;s it it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="4342.32" dur="3.66">inefficient for them to to go after that</text><text start="4344.3" dur="3.96">uh but there&amp;#39;s also complicated</text><text start="4345.98" dur="4.5">questions of uh what is and isn&amp;#39;t harm</text><text start="4348.26" dur="4.08">what isn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t misinformation</text><text start="4350.48" dur="4.62">so this is one of the things that</text><text start="4352.34" dur="4.379">Wikipedia has also tried to face I</text><text start="4355.1" dur="4.98">remember asking</text><text start="4356.719" dur="4.801">um GPT about whether the virus leaked</text><text start="4360.08" dur="4.86">from a lab or not and the answer</text><text start="4361.52" dur="7.199">provided was a very nuanced one</text><text start="4364.94" dur="5.52">and uh a well-cited one almost dare I</text><text start="4368.719" dur="5.341">say well thought out one</text><text start="4370.46" dur="5.52">uh balanced I would hate for that Nuance</text><text

I I really</text><text start="4407.54" dur="4.02">agree with what you&amp;#39;re pushing on I mean</text><text start="4409.4" dur="4.44">the the core</text><text start="4411.56" dur="5.099">I think the core shape of the problem</text><text start="4413.84" dur="5.879">is that there are some harms that I</text><text start="4416.659" dur="4.04">think everyone agrees are bad right so</text><text start="4419.719" dur="3.901">yeah</text><text start="4420.699" dur="5.261">sexual exploitation of children right</text><text start="4423.62" dur="4.14">like you&amp;#39;re not going to get many people</text><text start="4425.96" dur="3.6">who who think that that type of thing</text><text start="4427.76" dur="3.54">should be allowed on any service right</text><text start="4429.56" dur="4.38">and that&amp;#39;s something that we that we</text><text start="4431.3" dur="4.8">face and try to push off the you know as</text><text start="4433.94" dur="3.9">as much as possible today</text><text start="4436.1" dur="4.079">um you know terrorism</text><text start="4437.84" dur="3.54">um and citing violence right it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="4440.179" dur="3.301">we went through a bunch of these these</text><text start="4441.38" dur="3.6">types of harms before</text><text start="4443.48" dur="3.12">um</text><text start="4444.98" dur="4.02">but then I do think that you get to a</text><text start="4446.6" dur="4.2">set of harms where there is more social</text><text start="4449" dur="5.82">debate around it</text><text start="4450.8" dur="5.46">um so misinformation I think is</text><text start="4454.82" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="4456.26" dur="4.32">has been a really tricky one because</text><text start="4458.6" dur="4.619">there are things

dur="3.48">challenges there</text><text start="4481.04" dur="4.199">but then I think that there are other</text><text start="4483.199" dur="3.301">places where it is</text><text start="4485.239" dur="3.361">um let me just take some of the stuff</text><text start="4486.5" dur="3.36">around covet earlier on in the pandemic</text><text start="4488.6" dur="3.66">where</text><text start="4489.86" dur="4.98">um there were you know real Health</text><text start="4492.26" dur="4.2">implications but there hadn&amp;#39;t been time</text><text start="4494.84" dur="3.899">to fully vet a bunch of the scientific</text><text start="4496.46" dur="4.08">assumptions and you know unfortunately I</text><text start="4498.739" dur="3.361">think a lot of the kind of establishment</text><text start="4500.54" dur="3">on that</text><text start="4502.1" dur="3.599">um you know kind of waffled on a bunch</text><text start="4503.54" dur="3.48">of facts and you know asked for a bunch</text><text start="4505.699" dur="4.201">of things to be censored that in</text><text start="4507.02" dur="5.82">retrospect ended up being you know more</text><text start="4509.9" dur="4.5">debatable or or true and that stuff is</text><text start="4512.84" dur="4.08">really tough right really undermines</text><text start="4514.4" dur="3.72">trust in in that and</text><text start="4516.92" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="4518.12" dur="4.46">so I I do think that the questions</text><text start="4520.76" dur="4.38">around how to manage that are are are</text><text start="4522.58" dur="5.38">very nuanced the way that I try to think</text><text start="4525.14" dur="5.099">about it is that um</text><text start="4527.96" dur="5.82">it goes I think it&amp;#39;s best to generally</text><text start="4530.239" dur="5.101">boil things down to the harms that</text><text start="4533.78" dur="3.72">people agree on so when you think about</text><text start="4535.34" dur="4.8">you know is something misinformation or</text><text start="4537.5" dur="3.6">not I think often the more Salient bit</text><text start="4540.14" dur="3.84">is</text><text start="4541.1" dur="4.38">is this going to potentially leave lead</text><text start="4543.98" dur="4.259">to um</text><text start="4545.48" dur="4.679">to physical harm for someone</text><text start="4548.239" dur="3.541">um and kind of think about it in that</text><text start="4550.159" dur="2.881">sense and then beyond that I think</text><text start="4551.78" dur="3.36">people just have different preferences</text><text start="4553.04" dur="3.48">on how they want things to be flagged</text><text start="4555.14" dur="4.5">for them I think a bunch of people would</text><text start="4556.52" dur="4.32">be like prefer to kind of have a a flag</text><text start="4559.64" dur="2.76">on something that says hey a fact</text><text start="4560.84" dur="2.52">Checker thinks that this might be false</text><text start="4562.4" dur="2.46">or</text><text start="4563.36" dur="4.859">um I think Twitter&amp;#39;s Community notes</text><text start="4564.86" dur="4.859">implementation is quite good on on this</text><text start="4568.219" dur="3.601">um but again it&amp;#39;s the same type of thing</text><text start="4569.719" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s like just kind of discretionarily</text><text start="4571.82" dur="3.78">adding a flag because it makes the user</text><text start="4573.739" dur="3.061">experience better but it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="4575.6" dur="2.76">you know trying to take down the</text><text start="4576.8" dur="4.5">information or not that you want to</text><text start="4578.36" dur="5.52">reserve the kind of censorship of</text><text start="4581.3" dur="4.859">content to things that are of known</text><text start="4583.88" dur="3.66">categories that that people generally</text><text start="4586.159" dur="3.781">agree or bad</text><text start="4587.54" dur="4.38">yeah but there&amp;#39;s so many</text><text start="4589.94" dur="4.62">things especially with the pandemic but</text><text start="4591.92" dur="6.6">there&amp;#39;s other topics where there&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="4594.56" dur="6.599">deep disagreement fueled by politics</text><text start="4598.52" dur="5.639">about what is and isn&amp;#39;t harmful</text><text start="4601.159" dur="5.341">there&amp;#39;s uh even just the degree to which</text><text start="4604.159" dur="3.121">the virus is

harmful there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="4611.659" dur="3.961">almost like a political divider on that</text><text start="4614" dur="3.78">and so</text><text start="4615.62" dur="4.74">how do you make decisions about that</text><text start="4617.78" dur="5.16">where half the country in the United</text><text start="4620.36" dur="5.28">States or some large fraction of the</text><text start="4622.94" dur="4.92">world has very different views from</text><text start="4625.64" dur="4.519">another part of the world</text><text start="4627.86" dur="5.4">is there a way</text><text start="4630.159" dur="5.141">out of the uh I mean the moderation of</text><text start="4633.26" dur="4.56">this I think we</text><text start="4635.3" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text><text start="4637.82" dur="5.22">just abstain but but I think we should</text><text start="4640.58" dur="4.56">be clear about which of these things are</text><text start="4643.04" dur="4.5">actual safety concerns</text><text start="4645.14" dur="4.019">and which ones are a matter of</text><text start="4647.54" dur="3.6">preference in terms of how people want</text><text start="4649.159" dur="4.441">information flagged right so we did</text><text start="4651.14" dur="4.32">recently introduce something that allows</text><text start="4653.6" dur="4.2">people</text><text start="4655.46" dur="4.02">to have fact checking not affect the</text><text start="4657.8" dur="2.82">distribution of of</text><text start="4659.48" dur="2.759">um of what shows them their products so</text><text start="4660.62" dur="3.78">a bunch of people don&amp;#39;t trust who the</text><text start="4662.239" dur="4.261">fact Checkers are all right well you can</text><text start="4664.4" dur="4.2">you can turn that off if you want but if</text><text start="4666.5" dur="4.14">the if the if the content you know</text><text start="4668.6" dur="3.18">violates some policy like it&amp;#39;s inciting</text><text start="4670.64" dur="3.36">violence or something like that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4671.78" dur="3.72">still not going to be allowed so I I</text><text start="4674" dur="3.719">think that you want to honor people&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4675.5" dur="3.9">preferences on on that as much as</text><text start="4677.719" dur="2.281">possible</text><text start="4679.4" dur="2.339">um</text><text start="4680" dur="5.04">but look I mean this is really difficult</text><text start="4681.739" dur="6">stuff I think the it&amp;#39;s really hard to</text><text start="4685.04" dur="6.06">know where to draw the line on</text><text start="4687.739" dur="6.241">what is fact and what is opinion because</text><text start="4691.1" dur="4.559">the nature of science is that nothing is</text><text start="4693.98" dur="4.08">ever a hundred percent known for certain</text><text start="4695.659" dur="4.681">you can disprove certain things but</text><text start="4698.06" dur="3.659">you&amp;#39;re constantly testing new hypotheses</text><text start="4700.34" dur="3.66">and</text><text start="4701.719" dur="4.44">um you know scrutinizing Frameworks that</text><text start="4704" dur="4.199">have been long held and every once in a</text><text start="4706.159" dur="3.54">while you you throw out something that</text><text start="4708.199" dur="2.46">was working for a very long period of</text><text start="4709.699" dur="3.241">time and</text><text start="4710.659" dur="3.601">it&amp;#39;s very difficult but</text><text start="4712.94" dur="2.64">um but I think that just because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4714.26" dur="3.24">very hard and just because their edge</text><text start="4715.58" dur="3.42">cases doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you</text><text start="4717.5" dur="3.179">you should not</text><text start="4719" dur="4.02">try to give people what they&amp;#39;re looking</text><text start="4720.679" dur="6">for as well</text><text start="4723.02" dur="5.82">let me ask about something you faced in</text><text start="4726.679" dur="5.641">terms of moderation</text><text start="4728.84" dur="5.94">is uh pressure from different sources</text><text start="4732.32" dur="4.56">pressure from governments I want to ask</text><text start="4734.78" dur="6">a question how to withstand</text><text start="4736.88" dur="6.72">that pressure for a world where AI</text><text start="4740.78" dur="5.34">moderation starts becoming a thing too</text><text start="4743.6" dur="5.88">so what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="4746.12" dur="5.46">um meta&amp;#39;s approach to uh</text><text start="4749.48" dur="4.199">to resist the pressure from governments</text><text start="4751.58" dur="4.92">and other interest groups in terms of</text><text start="4753.679" dur="4.201">what to moderate and not</text><text start="4756.5" dur="3.42">I don&amp;#39;t know that there&amp;#39;s like a</text><text start="4757.88" dur="3.24">one-size-fits-all answer to that and I</text><text start="4759.92" dur="4.08">think we</text><text start="4761.12" dur="5.099">basically have the principles around</text><text start="4764" dur="5.1">you know we want to allow people to</text><text start="4766.219" dur="5.821">express as much as possible but</text><text start="4769.1" dur="6.24">we have developed clear</text><text start="4772.04" dur="5.46">IES of things that we think are</text><text start="4775.34" dur="4.5">wrong that we don&amp;#39;t want on our services</text><text start="4777.5" dur="4.56">and we build tools to try to moderate</text><text start="4779.84" dur="3.359">those so then the question is okay what</text><text start="4782.06" dur="3.659">do you do</text><text start="4783.199" dur="5.101">when a government says</text><text start="4785.719" dur="5.221">that they don&amp;#39;t want something</text><text start="4788.3" dur="5.04">on on the service and</text><text start="4790.94" dur="4.02">I think we have we have a bunch of</text><text start="4793.34" dur="3.42">um principles around how we deal with</text><text start="4794.96" dur="3.779">that because on on the one hand if</text><text start="4796.76" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s a you know democratically</text><text start="4798.739" dur="4.561">elected government and people around the</text><text start="4801.679" dur="4.5">world just have different values in</text><text start="4803.3" dur="6.899">different places then you know should we</text><text start="4806.179" dur="5.581">as uh you know california-based company</text><text start="4810.199" dur="5.04">tell them</text><text start="4811.76" dur="7.02">that something that they have decided is</text><text start="4815.239" dur="5.821">unacceptable actually like that we need</text><text start="4818.78" dur="4.14">to be able to to to to express that I</text><text start="4821.06" dur="3.96">mean I think that&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a certain</text><text start="4822.92" dur="4.5">amount of um</text><text start="4825.02" dur="3.48">of hubris in that</text><text start="4827.42" dur="3.72">um but then I think there are other</text><text start="4828.5" dur="4.92">cases where you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a</text><text start="4831.14" dur="4.98">little more autocratic and you know you</text><text start="4833.42" dur="4.92">have the dictator leader who&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="4836.12" dur="5.22">trying to crack down on descent and you</text><text start="4838.34" dur="4.98">know the people in a country are really</text><text start="4841.34" dur="4.08">um not aligned with that and it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="4843.32" dur="4.2">necessarily against their culture but um</text><text start="4845.42" dur="3.18">but the the person who&amp;#39;s leading it is</text><text start="4847.52" dur="2.46">just trying to push in a certain</text><text start="4848.6" dur="4.559">direction</text><text start="4849.98" dur="6.239">um these are very complex questions uh</text><text start="4853.159" dur="7.02">but I I think so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s difficult to</text><text start="4856.219" dur="6.361">have have a one-size-fits all</text><text start="4860.179" dur="4.861">um approach to it but in general we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="4862.58" dur="5.88">pretty active and and kind of advocating</text><text start="4865.04" dur="6.54">and pushing back on on um</text><text start="4868.46" dur="4.739">requests to take things down</text><text start="4871.58" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="4873.199" dur="5.221">but honestly the thing that I think a</text><text start="4875.36" dur="6">request to censor things is one thing</text><text start="4878.42" dur="4.86">um and that&amp;#39;s obviously bad but were we</text><text start="4881.36" dur="3.78">um draw a much harder line</text><text start="4883.28" dur="4.919">is on requests for access to information</text><text start="4885.14" dur="4.32">right because you know if you can</text><text start="4888.199" dur="2.761">if you get told that you can&amp;#39;t say</text><text start="4889.46" dur="3.66">something I mean</text><text start="4890.96" dur="6.779">that&amp;#39;s bad right I mean that that you</text><text start="4893.12" dur="7.14">know is is obviously it violates your</text><text start="4897.739" dur="3.721">sense and freedom of expression at some</text><text start="4900.26" dur="2.939">level but</text><text start="4901.46" dur="5.4">um but a government getting access to</text><text start="4903.199" dur="6.361">data in a way that seems</text><text start="4906.86" dur="4.08">um like it would be unlawful in in our</text><text start="4909.56" dur="4.74">country</text><text start="4910.94" dur="4.86">um exposes people to real physical harm</text><text start="4914.3" dur="3.84">um and</text><text start="4915.8" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s something that in general we take</text><text start="4918.14" dur="5.099">very seriously and then so there&amp;#39;s that</text><text start="4921.32" dur="4.02">flows through like all of our policies</text><text start="4923.239" dur="4.081">and in a lot of ways right it&amp;#39;s by the</text><text start="4925.34" dur="3.96">time you&amp;#39;re actually like litigating</text><text start="4927.32" dur="4.2">with a government or pushing back on</text><text start="4929.3" dur="3.899">them that&amp;#39;s pretty late in the funnel</text><text start="4931.52" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;d say</text><text start="4933.199" dur="4.02">a bunch of this stuff starts a lot</text><text start="4935.36" dur="4.62">higher up in the decision of where do we</text><text start="4937.219" dur="4.44">put data centers then</text><text start="4939.98" dur="2.82">um there are a lot of countries where</text><text start="4941.659" dur="3.601">you know we may have a lot of people</text><text start="4942.8" dur="4.859">using the service in a place it might be</text><text start="4945.26" dur="3.72">you know good for the service in some</text><text start="4947.659" dur="2.641">ways</text><text start="4948.98" dur="3.239">um good for those people if we could</text><text start="4950.3" dur="3.96">reduce the latency by having a data</text><text start="4952.219" dur="4.201">center nearby them</text><text start="4954.26" dur="4.26">but you know for whatever reason we just</text><text start="4956.42" dur="5.52">feel like hey this government does not</text><text start="4958.52" dur="4.76">have a good track record on on um</text><text start="4961.94" dur="3.84">ew</text><text start="4963.28" dur="4.24">basically not trying to get access to</text><text start="4965.78" dur="3.66">people&amp;#39;s data and at the end of the day</text><text start="4967.52" dur="3.48">I mean if you put a data center in a</text><text start="4969.44" dur="3.9">country and the government wants to get</text><text start="4971" dur="4.26">access to people&amp;#39;s data then you know</text><text start="4973.34" dur="3.54">they do at the end of the day have the</text><text start="4975.26" dur="5.04">option of having people show up with</text><text start="4976.88" dur="4.5">guns and taking it by force so I I think</text><text start="4980.3" dur="2.76">that there&amp;#39;s like a lot of decisions</text><text start="4981.38" dur="3.06">that go into like how you architect the</text><text start="4983.06" dur="2.04">systems</text><text start="4984.44" dur="4.38">um</text><text start="4985.1" dur="5.94">years in advance of these actual</text><text start="4988.82" dur="4.5">confrontations that end up being really</text><text start="4991.04" dur="5.639">important so you put the protection of</text><text start="4993.32" dur="6.24">people&amp;#39;s data as a very very high</text><text start="4996.679" dur="4.02">priority but that I think is a there are</text><text start="4999.56" dur="2.94">more harms that I think can be</text><text start="5000.699" dur="3.781">associated with that and and I think</text><text start="5002.5" dur="4.92">that that ends up being a more critical</text><text start="5004.48" dur="3.6">thing to defend against governments</text><text start="5007.42" dur="2.34">um</text><text start="5008.08" dur="2.94">then you know whereas you know if</text><text start="5009.76" dur="3.06">another government has a different view</text><text start="5011.02" dur="3.06">of what should be acceptable speech in</text><text start="5012.82" dur="2.7">their country</text><text start="5014.08" dur="3.119">especially if it&amp;#39;s a democratically</text><text start="5015.52" dur="3.659">elected government and you know it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5017.199" dur="3.181">then I I think that there&amp;#39;s a certain</text><text start="5019.179" dur="4.081">amount of deference that you should have</text><text start="5020.38" dur="4.92">to that so it&amp;#39;s uh that&amp;#39;s speaking more</text><text start="5023.26" dur="4.56">to the direct harm that&amp;#39;s possible when</text><text start="5025.3" dur="4.919">you give governments access to data but</text><text start="5027.82" dur="5.1">if we look at the United States</text><text start="5030.219" dur="4.921">to the more nuanced kind of pressure to</text><text start="5032.92" dur="4.799">censor not even order to censor but</text><text start="5035.14" dur="4.98">pressure sensor from political entities</text><text start="5037.719" dur="5.881">which is kind of received quite a bit of</text><text start="5040.12" dur="6.42">attention in the United States uh</text><text start="5043.6" dur="5.7">maybe one way to ask that question is</text><text start="5046.54" dur="5.1">if

very</text><text start="5181.42" dur="4.14">active debate and I and I understand it</text><text start="5183.639" dur="6.121">right I mean these are you know these</text><text start="5185.56" dur="5.46">these kind of questions get to really</text><text start="5189.76" dur="3.24">some of the most important social</text><text start="5191.02" dur="3.179">debates that that are that are being had</text><text start="5193" dur="3.06">so</text><text start="5194.199" dur="3.601">um it gets back to the question of truth</text><text start="5196.06" dur="3.48">because</text><text start="5197.8" dur="3.839">for a lot of these things they haven&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5199.54" dur="3.119">yet been hardened into a single truth</text><text start="5201.639" dur="2.641">and</text><text

on</text><text start="5207.52" dur="3.54">certain issues maybe in a few hundred</text><text start="5209.679" dur="2.821">years everyone will look back and say</text><text start="5211.06"

that meat</text><text start="5215.679" dur="5.46">grinder now and you know and and</text><text start="5218.159" dur="4.301">working through that so</text><text start="5221.139" dur="4.321">um</text><text start="5222.46" dur="5.64">so no these are these are all are all</text><text start="5225.46" dur="4.259">very complicated and</text><text start="5228.1" dur="4.619">you know some people</text><text start="5229.719" dur="4.261">raise concerns in good faith and just</text><text start="5232.719" dur="2.94">say hey this is something that I want to</text><text start="5233.98" dur="4.08">flag for you to think about</text><text start="5235.659" dur="4.56">certain people I I certainly think like</text><text start="5238.06" dur="4.74">comment things with someone of a more</text><text start="5240.219" dur="5.761">kind of punitive or</text><text start="5242.8" dur="4.56">vengeful view of like I like I want you</text><text start="5245.98" dur="2.58">to do this thing

like</text><text start="5252.52" dur="3.78">I don&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s just this is like</text><text start="5254.56" dur="3.599">this is one of the most pressurized</text><text start="5256.3" dur="4.14">debates I think in society so I just</text><text start="5258.159" dur="3.48">think that there are so many people in</text><text start="5260.44" dur="2.759">different forces that are trying to</text><text start="5261.639" dur="3.841">apply pressure from different sides that</text><text start="5263.199" dur="3.721">it&amp;#39;s I I don&amp;#39;t think you can make</text><text start="5265.48" dur="4.32">decisions based on trying to make people</text><text start="5266.92" dur="5.52">happy I think you just have to do what</text><text start="5269.8" dur="5.58">you think is the right balance and</text><text start="5272.44" dur="4.5">accept that people are going to be upset</text><text start="5275.38" dur="4.859">no matter where you come out on that</text><text start="5276.94" dur="5.1">yeah I like that pressurized debate uh</text><text start="5280.239" dur="5.061">so how&amp;#39;s your view of the freedom of</text><text start="5282.04" dur="3.26">speech evolved over the years</text><text start="5285.34" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="5287.8" dur="4.859">and now they I</text><text start="5290.56" dur="6.119">where the freedom might apply to them</text><text start="5292.659" dur="5.821">not just to the humans but to the uh the</text><text start="5296.679" dur="3.301">personalized agents as you&amp;#39;ve spoken</text><text start="5298.48" dur="3.6">about them</text><text start="5299.98" dur="3.9">so yeah I mean I I&amp;#39;ve probably gotten to</text><text start="5302.08" dur="3.659">someone more nuanced view just because I</text><text start="5303.88" dur="4.02">think that there are you know I I come</text><text start="5305.739" dur="3.841">at this I&amp;#39;m obviously very Pro</text><text start="5307.9" dur="3.839">freedom of expression right I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5309.58" dur="3.78">think you build a service like this that</text><text start="5311.739" dur="3.121">gives people tools to express themselves</text><text start="5313.36" dur="2.94">unless you think that people expressing</text><text start="5314.86" dur="4.62">themselves at scale is a good thing</text><text start="5316.3" dur="5.76">right so I I get into this to like try</text><text start="5319.48" dur="3.78">to prevent people from from expressing</text><text start="5322.06" dur="3.599">anything I like want to give people</text><text start="5323.26" dur="4.74">tools so they can express as much as</text><text start="5325.659" dur="4.921">possible and then I think</text><text start="5328" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s become clear that there are certain</text><text start="5330.58" dur="2.22">categories of things that we&amp;#39;ve talked</text><text start="5332.08" dur="2.639">about</text><text start="5332.8" dur="3.359">I think almost everyone accepts or are</text><text start="5334.719" dur="2.94">bad and that no one wants and that</text><text start="5336.159" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re that are illegal even in</text><text start="5337.659" dur="4.5">countries like the US where you know you</text><text start="5339.76" dur="4.8">have the the First Amendment that&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="5342.159" dur="4.08">protective of of enabling speech it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5344.56" dur="2.52">like you&amp;#39;re still not allowed to you</text><text start="5346.239" dur="2.821">know do things that are gonna</text><text start="5347.08" dur="3.48">immediately inside violence or you know</text><text start="5349.06" dur="3.659">violate people&amp;#39;s intellectual property</text><text start="5350.56" dur="5.82">or things like that so through those but</text><text start="5352.719" dur="6.061">then there&amp;#39;s also a very active core of</text><text start="5356.38" dur="4.02">just active disagreements in society</text><text start="5358.78" dur="3.3">where some people may think that</text><text start="5360.4" dur="3.54">something is true or false the other</text><text start="5362.08" dur="5.76">side might think it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5363.94" dur="5.34">the opposite or just unsettled right and</text><text start="5367.84" dur="3.6">um and those are some of the most</text><text start="5369.28" dur="3.72">difficult to to kind of handle like like</text><text start="5371.44" dur="4.82">we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text><text start="5373" dur="3.26">but um</text><text start="5376.48" dur="3.48">one of the lessons that I feel like I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="5378.1" dur="4.74">learned is that</text><text start="5379.96" dur="4.92">a lot of times</text><text start="5382.84" dur="4.56">when you can</text><text start="5384.88" dur="5.58">the best way to handle this stuff</text><text start="5387.4" dur="4.799">more practically is not in terms of</text><text start="5390.46" dur="4.739">answering the question of should this be</text><text start="5392.199" dur="5.04">allowed but just like</text><text start="5395.199" dur="3.781">what</text><text start="5397.239" dur="3.361">what is the best way to deal with</text><text start="5398.98" dur="5.1">someone being a jerk</text><text start="5400.6" dur="5.4">is the person basically just having a</text><text start="5404.08" dur="4.98">like repeat</text><text start="5406" dur="6.36">behavior of like</text><text start="5409.06" dur="6.179">causing a lot of a lot of issues so</text><text start="5412.36" dur="4.74">looking at it more at that level and its</text><text start="5415.239" dur="3.96">effect on the broader communities Health</text><text start="5417.1" dur="4.02">the community health</text><text start="5419.199" dur="4.261">It&amp;#39;s Tricky though because like how do</text><text start="5421.12" dur="4.26">you know there could be people</text><text start="5423.46" dur="4.259">that have a very controversial Viewpoint</text><text start="5425.38" dur="4.02">that turns out to have a positive</text><text start="5427.719" dur="3.48">long-term effect on the health of the</text><text start="5429.4" dur="3.9">community because it challenges the</text><text start="5431.199" dur="3.601">community that&amp;#39;s true absolutely it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5433.3" dur="3.6">yeah no I think you and I think you want</text><text start="5434.8" dur="4.8">to be careful about that I&amp;#39;m not sure</text><text start="5436.9" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;m expressing this very very clearly</text><text start="5439.6" dur="2.579">um</text><text start="5440.32" dur="4.14">because I certainly agree with your your</text><text start="5442.179" dur="3.661">point there and my point isn&amp;#39;t that we</text><text start="5444.46" dur="3.6">should</text><text start="5445.84" dur="3.42">not have people on our services that are</text><text start="5448.06" dur="2.46">that are that are being controversial</text><text start="5449.26" dur="2.399">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s certainly not what I mean</text><text start="5450.52" dur="4.82">to say</text><text start="5451.659" dur="3.681">um it&amp;#39;s that often I think</text><text start="5455.38" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s not just looking at a specific</text><text start="5458.139" dur="4.981">example of speech that it&amp;#39;s most</text><text start="5460.3" dur="4.56">effective to to handle this stuff</text><text start="5463.12" dur="3.48">um and and I I think often you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5464.86" dur="4.14">want to make specific binary decisions</text><text start="5466.6" dur="4.68">of kind of this is allowed or this isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5469" dur="4.08">I mean we talked about you know it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5471.28" dur="3.72">fact checking or Twitter&amp;#39;s Community</text><text start="5473.08" dur="3.659">Voices thing I think that&amp;#39;s another good</text><text start="5475" dur="4.199">example it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not a question of</text><text start="5476.739" dur="3.96">is this allowed or not it&amp;#39;s just a</text><text start="5479.199" dur="3.901">question of adding more context to the</text><text start="5480.699" dur="4.201">thing I think that that&amp;#39;s helpful so in</text><text start="5483.1" dur="3.9">the context of AI which is is what</text><text start="5484.9" dur="5.4">you&amp;#39;re asking about and there are lots</text><text start="5487" dur="5.52">of ways that an AI can be helpful</text><text start="5490.3" dur="4.439">you know with with an AI it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s less</text><text start="5492.52" dur="4.38">about censorship right because and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5494.739" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s more about what is the most</text><text start="5496.9" dur="4.92">productive answer to a question</text><text start="5499.719" dur="4.381">um you know there&amp;#39;s one case study that</text><text start="5501.82" dur="4.319">I was reviewing with the the team is</text><text start="5504.1" dur="4.16">someone asked</text><text start="5506.139" dur="2.121">um</text><text start="5508.96" dur="5.84">can you explain to me how to 3D print a</text><text start="5512.139" dur="6.721">gun and</text><text start="5514.8" dur="5.56">one proposed response is like no I can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5518.86" dur="2.46">talk about that right it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="5520.36" dur="2.04">basically just like shut it down</text><text start="5521.32" dur="2.64">immediately</text><text start="5522.4" dur="3.36">which I think is is some of what you see</text><text start="5523.96" dur="3.179">it&amp;#39;s like as a large language model I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="5525.76" dur="2.64">not allowed to talk about you know</text><text start="5527.139" dur="1.981">whatever</text><text start="5528.4" dur="2.22">um</text><text start="5529.12" dur="2.34">but there&amp;#39;s another response which is</text><text start="5530.62" dur="2.22">like hey</text><text start="5531.46" dur="3.779">you know I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="5532.84" dur="5.339">idea in a lot of countries</text><text start="5535.239" dur="4.801">um including the US 3D printing guns is</text><text start="5538.179" dur="3.901">illegal or or kind of whatever the</text><text start="5540.04" dur="3.96">factual thing is it&amp;#39;s like okay you know</text><text start="5542.08" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s actually a respectful and</text><text start="5544" dur="5.219">informative answer and you know I may</text><text start="5545.86" dur="5.1">have not known that specific thing and</text><text start="5549.219" dur="5.341">um so there are different ways to handle</text><text start="5550.96" dur="6.42">this that I think kind of you can either</text><text start="5554.56" dur="4.32">you can either assume good intent</text><text start="5557.38" dur="3.24">like maybe the person didn&amp;#39;t know and</text><text start="5558.88" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m just going to help educate them or</text><text start="5560.62" dur="2.82">you could like kind of come at it as</text><text start="5562.12" dur="2.94">like no I need to shut this thing down</text><text start="5563.44" dur="3.779">immediately right it&amp;#39;s like I just I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="5565.06" dur="4.74">not going to talk about this like</text><text start="5567.219" dur="5.641">um and there would be times where you</text><text start="5569.8" dur="4.56">need to do that but I actually think</text><text start="5572.86" dur="4.08">having a</text><text start="5574.36" dur="4.319">somewhat more informative approach where</text><text start="5576.94" dur="2.82">you generally assume good intent from</text><text

dur="3.9">have we have projects that explore a lot</text><text start="5686.08" dur="3.36">of different things and this is</text><text start="5687.94" dur="4.44">certainly one that I think could be</text><text start="5689.44" dur="5.1">interesting but so what&amp;#39;s the uh release</text><text start="5692.38" dur="4.799">the launch date of that again</text><text start="5694.54" dur="3.84">or uh yeah what&amp;#39;s the official website</text><text start="5697.179" dur="4.261">and uh</text><text start="5698.38" dur="5.04">but we don&amp;#39;t have that yet oh okay but I</text><text start="5701.44" dur="3.779">um all right and and look I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5703.42" dur="3.6">know exactly how this is gonna turn out</text><text start="5705.219" dur="3.42">I mean what I can say is yeah there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5707.02" dur="2.699">there&amp;#39;s some people working on this</text><text start="5708.639" dur="3.901">right I think that there&amp;#39;s something</text><text start="5709.719" dur="3.841">there that that um that&amp;#39;s interesting to</text><text start="5712.54" dur="3">explore</text><text start="5713.56" dur="4.079">so if you look at it&amp;#39;d be interesting</text><text start="5715.54" dur="5.28">just to ask this question and throw</text><text start="5717.639" dur="6.481">Twitter into the mix at the landscape of</text><text start="5720.82" dur="4.5">social networks that is Facebook that is</text><text start="5724.12" dur="3.78">Instagram</text><text start="5725.32" dur="5.339">that is WhatsApp</text><text start="5727.9" dur="4.5">and then think of a text-based social</text><text start="5730.659" dur="3.661">network when you look at that landscape</text><text start="5732.4" dur="2.58">what are the interesting differences to</text><text start="5734.32" dur="3.419">you</text><text start="5734.98" dur="5.159">why do we have these different flavors</text><text start="5737.739" dur="3.9">and what what what are the needs what</text><text start="5740.139" dur="3.54">are the use cases what are the products</text><text start="5741.639" dur="4.56">what what is the aspect of them that</text><text start="5743.679" dur="4.381">create a fulfilling Human Experience and</text><text start="5746.199" dur="4.261">and a connection between humans that is</text><text start="5748.06" dur="5.52">somehow distinct well I think text is</text><text start="5750.46" dur="5.4">very accessible for people to transmit</text><text start="5753.58" dur="4.139">ideas and to have back and forth</text><text start="5755.86" dur="6.06">exchanges</text><text start="5757.719" dur="7.44">um so it I think ends up being a good</text><text start="5761.92" dur="5.759">a good format for discussion in a lot of</text><text start="5765.159" dur="4.261">ways uniquely good right if you look at</text><text start="5767.679" dur="3.181">um if some of the other formats or other</text><text start="5769.42" dur="2.94">networks that have focused on one type</text><text start="5770.86" dur="3.96">of content like Tick Tock is obviously</text><text start="5772.36" dur="5.04">huge right and there are comments on</text><text start="5774.82" dur="5.28">Tick Tock but you know I think the</text><text start="5777.4" dur="4.44">architecture of the service is very</text><text start="5780.1" dur="3.42">clearly that you have the video is the</text><text start="5781.84" dur="3.96">primary thing and there&amp;#39;s you know</text><text start="5783.52" dur="4.679">comments after that</text><text start="5785.8" dur="6.3">um and</text><text start="5788.199" dur="4.94">um but I think one of the unique pieces</text><text start="5792.1" dur="4.2">of having</text><text start="5793.139" dur="6.58">text-based comments like content is that</text><text start="5796.3" dur="6.18">the comments can also be first class and</text><text start="5799.719" dur="4.681">that makes it so that conversations can</text><text start="5802.48" dur="3.9">just filter and Fork into all these</text><text start="5804.4" dur="3.839">different directions and in a way that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5806.38" dur="2.94">that can be super useful so I think</text><text start="5808.239" dur="3">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that are really</text><text start="5809.32" dur="3.18">awesome about the experience it just</text><text start="5811.239" dur="3.42">always struck me</text><text start="5812.5" dur="4.139">I I always thought that you know Twitter</text><text start="5814.659" dur="3.961">should have a billion people using it or</text><text start="5816.639" dur="4.261">whatever the thing is that</text><text start="5818.62" dur="3.9">um that that that basically ends up</text><text start="5820.9" dur="3.66">being in that space and for whatever</text><text start="5822.52" dur="4.04">combination of reasons again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5824.56" dur="4.5">these are these companies are complex</text><text start="5826.56" dur="4.84">organisms and it&amp;#39;s very hard to diagnose</text><text start="5829.06" dur="5.639">this stuff from the outside why doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="5831.4" dur="7.02">Twitter why doesn&amp;#39;t a text based</text><text start="5834.699" dur="6.421">comment as a first citizen based social</text><text start="5838.42" dur="4.08">network have a billion users well I just</text><text start="5841.12" dur="5.64">think it&amp;#39;s hard to build these companies</text><text start="5842.5" dur="6.06">so it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s not that every idea</text><text start="5846.76" dur="3.36">automatically goes and gets a billion</text><text start="5848.56" dur="4.32">people it&amp;#39;s just that I think that that</text><text start="5850.12" dur="4.019">idea coupled with good execution should</text><text start="5852.88" dur="3.42">get there</text><text start="5854.139" dur="4.801">um but but I mean look we hit certain</text><text start="5856.3" dur="5.52">thresholds over time where</text><text start="5858.94" dur="3.96">you know we kind of plateaued early on</text><text start="5861.82" dur="2.64">and it wasn&amp;#39;t clear that we were ever</text><text start="5862.9" dur="4.62">going to reach 100 million people on</text><text start="5864.46" dur="5.279">Facebook and then we got really good at</text><text start="5867.52" dur="4.02">dialing in internationalization and</text><text start="5869.739" dur="3.781">helping the service grow in different</text><text start="5871.54" dur="3.54">countries and</text><text start="5873.52" dur="4.32">um and and that was like a whole</text><text start="5875.08" dur="5.22">competence that we needed to develop and</text><text start="5877.84" dur="4.08">um and helping people basically spread</text><text start="5880.3" dur="2.82">the service to their friends that was</text><text start="5881.92" dur="2.759">one of the things once we got very good</text><text start="5883.12" dur="4.619">at that that was one of the things that</text><text start="5884.679" dur="4.741">made me feel like hey if if Instagram</text><text start="5887.739" dur="3.121">joined us early on then I felt like we</text><text start="5889.42" dur="3.239">could help grow that quickly and same</text><text start="5890.86" dur="3.18">with WhatsApp and like that&amp;#39;s sort of</text><text start="5892.659" dur="3.601">been a core competence that we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="5894.04" dur="3.48">developed and been able to execute on</text><text start="5896.26" dur="3.3">and others have two right I mean bite</text><text start="5897.52" dur="4.44">dense obviously have done a very good</text><text start="5899.56" dur="3.54">job with Tick Tock and and have um you</text><text start="5901.96" dur="3.96">know reached more than a billion people</text><text start="5903.1" dur="4.86">there but um but it&amp;#39;s certainly not</text><text start="5905.92" dur="4.44">automatic right I think you need you</text><text start="5907.96" dur="4.739">need a certain level of of um of</text><text start="5910.36" dur="3.96">execution to basically get there and you</text><text start="5912.699" dur="3.841">know I think for whatever reason</text><text start="5914.32" dur="4.98">I think Twitter has this great idea and</text><text start="5916.54" dur="6.36">and sort of magic in the service</text><text start="5919.3" dur="5.16">um but I I they just haven&amp;#39;t kind of</text><text start="5922.9" dur="3.239">cracked that piece yet and I think that</text><text start="5924.46" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s made it&amp;#39;s that you you&amp;#39;re seeing</text><text start="5926.139" dur="2.941">all these other things whether it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5927.28" dur="3.72">Mastodon or</text><text start="5929.08" dur="4.44">um or or blue sky</text><text start="5931" dur="3.84">um that I think are you know maybe just</text><text start="5933.52" dur="3.06">different different cuts of the same</text><text start="5934.84" dur="4.02">thing but you know I think through the</text><text start="5936.58" dur="3.48">last generation of of um social media</text><text start="5938.86" dur="2.879">overall</text><text start="5940.06" dur="3.84">one of the interesting experiments that</text><text start="5941.739" dur="4.141">I think should get run at larger scale</text><text start="5943.9" dur="4.02">is what happens if there&amp;#39;s somewhat more</text><text start="5945.88" dur="5.52">decentralized control and if it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="5947.92" dur="5.279">the stack is more open throughout and</text><text start="5951.4" dur="3.96">um I&amp;#39;ve just been pretty fascinated by</text><text start="5953.199" dur="3">that and seeing how that works</text><text start="5955.36" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="5956.199" dur="4.98">to some degree end-to-end encryption</text><text start="5959.56" dur="4.079">um on WhatsApp and as we bring it to</text><text start="5961.179" dur="5.101">other services provides an element of it</text><text start="5963.639" dur="4.801">because it pushes the service really out</text><text start="5966.28" dur="4.439">to the edges I mean the the</text><text start="5968.44" dur="3.239">server part of this that we run for</text><text start="5970.719" dur="3.301">WhatsApp</text><text start="5971.679" dur="4.441">is relatively very thin compared to what</text><text start="5974.02" dur="4.38">we do on Facebook or Instagram</text><text start="5976.12" dur="4.32">and much more of the complexity is you</text><text start="5978.4" dur="4.319">know and how the apps kind of negotiate</text><text start="5980.44" dur="4.739">with each other to pass information in a</text><text start="5982.719" dur="3.781">in a fully intended encrypted way</text><text start="5985.179" dur="3.181">um but I don&amp;#39;t know I think that that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5986.5" dur="3.719">that is a good is a good model I think</text><text start="5988.36" dur="3.6">it puts more power in individuals hands</text><text start="5990.219" dur="3.42">and there are a lot of benefits of it if</text><text start="5991.96" dur="3.9">you can if you can make it happen again</text><text start="5993.639" dur="4.321">this is all like pretty speculative I I</text><text start="5995.86" dur="4.14">mean I I think that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s you know</text><text start="5997.96" dur="3.779">hard from the outside to know why</text><text start="6000" dur="4.139">anything does or doesn&amp;#39;t work until you</text><text start="6001.739" dur="3">kind of take a run at it and</text><text start="6004.139" dur="2.761">um</text><text start="6004.739" dur="3.781">so I I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of an</text><text start="6006.9" dur="2.88">interesting thing to experiment with but</text><text start="6008.52" dur="2.1">I don&amp;#39;t really know where this one&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6009.78" dur="4.02">going to go</text><text start="6010.62" dur="7.019">so since we were talking about Twitter</text><text start="6013.8" dur="5.58">uh Elon Musk had what I think a few</text><text start="6017.639" dur="4.921">harsh wards</text><text start="6019.38" dur="6">that I wish he didn&amp;#39;t say so let me ask</text><text start="6022.56" dur="4.98">uh in in in the Hope in the name of</text><text start="6025.38" dur="5.279">camaraderie what do you think Elon is</text><text start="6027.54" dur="5.82">doing well with Twitter and what as a</text><text start="6030.659" dur="4.741">person who has run for a long time you</text><text start="6033.36" dur="5.64">social networks</text><text start="6035.4" dur="6.9">Facebook Instagram WhatsApp</text><text start="6039" dur="5.34">uh what can he do better what can he</text><text start="6042.3" dur="4.5">improve on that text-based social</text><text start="6044.34" dur="5.16">network gosh it&amp;#39;s always very difficult</text><text start="6046.8" dur="4.8">to offer specific critiques from from</text><text start="6049.5" dur="3.36">the outside before you get into this</text><text start="6051.6" dur="2.16">because I think one thing that I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="6052.86" dur="2.4">learned</text><text start="6053.76" dur="3.419">is that</text><text start="6055.26" dur="3.6">everyone has opinions on what you should</text><text start="6057.179" dur="3.661">do and</text><text start="6058.86" dur="4.5">like running the company you see a lot</text><text start="6060.84" dur="5.339">of specific nuances on things that are</text><text start="6063.36" dur="5.7">not apparent externally and</text><text start="6066.179" dur="5.821">um I often</text><text start="6069.06" dur="4.38">think that some of the discourse around</text><text start="6072" dur="4.8">us would be</text><text start="6073.44" dur="5.279">could be better if if there was more</text><text start="6076.8" dur="3.12">kind of space for acknowledging that</text><text start="6078.719" dur="2.701">there&amp;#39;s certain things that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text><text start="6079.92" dur="2.7">internally that guide what we&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="6081.42" dur="2.7">but</text><text start="6082.62" dur="3.059">um but I don&amp;#39;t know I mean because since</text><text start="6084.12" dur="3.18">you asked what what is what is going</text><text

on to make Twitter a lot</text><text start="6100.56" dur="5.82">leaner and</text><text start="6103.02" dur="5.219">um and I think that that</text><text start="6106.38" dur="3.72">you know it&amp;#39;s like you can you can agree</text><text start="6108.239" dur="3.541">or disagree with exactly all the tactics</text><text start="6110.1" dur="4.5">and how and how we did that you know</text><text start="6111.78" dur="5.1">obviously you know every leader has</text><text start="6114.6" dur="3.78">their own style for if they you know if</text><text start="6116.88" dur="3.779">you need to make dramatic changes for</text><text start="6118.38" dur="5.16">that how you&amp;#39;re going to execute it</text><text start="6120.659" dur="4.861">um but a lot of the specific principles</text><text start="6123.54" dur="3.659">that he pushed on</text><text start="6125.52" dur="3.54">um around</text><text start="6127.199" dur="4.04">basically trying to make the</text><text start="6129.06" dur="4.079">organization more technical around</text><text start="6131.239" dur="5.021">decreasing the distance between</text><text start="6133.139" dur="5.641">Engineers of the company and and him</text><text start="6136.26" dur="3.479">like fewer layers of management</text><text start="6138.78" dur="3.78">um</text><text start="6139.739" dur="4.92">I think that those were generally good</text><text start="6142.56" dur="3.659">changes and I&amp;#39;m also</text><text start="6144.659" dur="3.06">I also think that it was probably good</text><text start="6146.219" dur="3.541">for the industry that he made those</text><text start="6147.719" dur="3.42">changes because my sense is that there</text><text start="6149.76" dur="3.3">were a lot of other people who thought</text><text

dur="3.721">I&amp;#39;ve heard from a lot of folks is is</text><text start="6169.679" dur="3.841">just hey you know when you when someone</text><text start="6171.36" dur="3.839">like you you know when I wrote the</text><text start="6173.52" dur="3.599">letter outlining the organizational</text><text start="6175.199" dur="3.901">changes that I wanted to make</text><text start="6177.119" dur="3.781">um back in March and when people see</text><text start="6179.1" dur="3.48">what Elon is doing</text><text start="6180.9" dur="3.54">um I think that that gives</text><text start="6182.58" dur="4.38">you know people</text><text start="6184.44" dur="4.679">the ability to Think Through how to</text><text start="6186.96" dur="5.46">shape their organizations in in a way</text><text start="6189.119" dur="4.981">that um that that you know hopefully can</text><text start="6192.42" dur="3.36">can be good for the industry and make</text><text start="6194.1" dur="3.24">all these companies more productive over</text><text start="6195.78" dur="3">time so</text><text start="6197.34" dur="3.18">um something that that was one where I</text><text start="6198.78" dur="4.02">think he was</text><text start="6200.52" dur="4.98">um quite ahead of of a bunch of the the</text><text start="6202.8" dur="3.78">other companies on and and you know what</text><text start="6205.5" dur="2.4">he was doing there</text><text start="6206.58" dur="2.7">you know again from the outside very</text><text start="6207.9" dur="2.64">hard to know it&amp;#39;s like okay did he did</text><text start="6209.28" dur="3.78">he cut too much did he knock enough</text><text start="6210.54" dur="4.44">whatever I I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s like my</text><text start="6213.06" dur="3.84">place to opine on that</text><text start="6214.98" dur="3.659">um and and you asked for a for a</text><text start="6216.9" dur="4.259">positive framing of the question of of</text><text start="6218.639" dur="4.5">what what do I um what do I admire what</text><text start="6221.159" dur="5.221">do I think it went well but I I think</text><text start="6223.139" dur="3.961">that like certainly his actions</text><text start="6226.38" dur="3.06">um</text><text start="6227.1" dur="4.559">led me and I think a lot of other folks</text><text start="6229.44" dur="4.739">in the industry to think about hey are</text><text start="6231.659" dur="4.56">we are we kind of doing this as much as</text><text start="6234.179" dur="3.48">we should like can we is it like could</text><text start="6236.219" dur="3.061">we make our companies better by pushing</text><text start="6237.659" dur="4.02">on some of the same principles</text><text start="6239.28" dur="4.02">well the two of you are in the top of</text><text start="6241.679" dur="3.301">the world in terms of leading the</text><text start="6243.3" dur="5.46">development of tech and I wish there was</text><text start="6244.98" dur="6.719">more uh both way camaraderie and</text><text start="6248.76" dur="5.7">kindness uh more love in the world</text><text start="6251.699" dur="5.94">because Love Is The Answer</text><text start="6254.46" dur="4.56">um but uh let me ask kind of a point of</text><text start="6257.639" dur="3.54">efficiency</text><text start="6259.02" dur="5.159">you recently announced multiple stages</text><text start="6261.179" dur="5.04">of layoffs and meta</text><text start="6264.179" dur="3.241">what are the most painful aspects of</text><text start="6266.219" dur="2.881">this process</text><text start="6267.42" dur="4.14">given</text><text start="6269.1" dur="4.139">for the individuals the painful effects</text><text start="6271.56" dur="3.36">it has on those people&amp;#39;s lives yeah I</text><text start="6273.239" dur="4.261">mean that&amp;#39;s sad</text><text start="6274.92" dur="4.739">and that&amp;#39;s it I mean it&amp;#39;s uh</text><text start="6277.5" dur="5.04">and you basically have</text><text start="6279.659" dur="4.681">a significant number of people who you</text><text start="6282.54" dur="5.22">know this is just not the end of their</text><text start="6284.34" dur="5.7">time at meta that they or</text><text start="6287.76" dur="4.08">or I you know would have hoped for when</text><text start="6290.04" dur="2.46">they joined the company</text><text start="6291.84" dur="2.64">um</text><text start="6292.5" dur="4.139">and</text><text start="6294.48" dur="3.12">I mean running a company there people</text><text start="6296.639" dur="3.181">are</text><text start="6297.6" dur="3.9">you know constantly joining and leaving</text><text start="6299.82" dur="4.799">the company for different directions but</text><text start="6301.5" dur="4.26">but for different different reasons but</text><text start="6304.619" dur="3.361">um</text><text start="6305.76" dur="5.22">and the layoffs are</text><text start="6307.98" dur="6">uniquely challenging and tough in that</text><text start="6310.98" dur="5.159">you have a lot of people leaving</text><text start="6313.98" dur="5.4">for reasons that aren&amp;#39;t connected to</text><text start="6316.139" dur="5.761">their own performance or you know the</text><text start="6319.38" dur="5.7">the culture not being a fit at that</text><text start="6321.9" dur="5.88">point it&amp;#39;s really just it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="6325.08" dur="5.28">kind of strategy decision and sometimes</text><text start="6327.78" dur="3.72">financially required</text><text start="6330.36" dur="3.6">um</text><text start="6331.5" dur="3.659">but not not fully in in our case and</text><text start="6333.96" dur="3.719">especially on the changes that we made</text><text start="6335.159" dur="4.741">this year A lot of it was more kind of</text><text start="6337.679" dur="4.741">culturally and strategically driven by</text><text start="6339.9" dur="5.219">this push where I wanted us to become a</text><text start="6342.42" dur="4.92">a stronger technology company with a</text><text start="6345.119" dur="4.261">more of a focus on building uh more</text><text start="6347.34" dur="4.74">Technical and and more of a focus on</text><text start="6349.38" dur="4.62">building higher quality products faster</text><text start="6352.08" dur="4.68">and I just view the external world is</text><text start="6354" dur="5.699">quite volatile right now and I wanted to</text><text start="6356.76" dur="5.22">make sure that we had a stable position</text><text start="6359.699" dur="5.46">to be able to continue investing in</text><text start="6361.98" dur="4.739">these long-term ambitious projects that</text><text start="6365.159" dur="3.96">we have around you know continuing to</text><text start="6366.719" dur="4.861">push AI forward and continuing to push</text><text start="6369.119" dur="4.56">forward all the metaverse work and in</text><text start="6371.58" dur="5.039">order to do that in light of the</text><text start="6373.679" dur="4.681">you know pretty big thrash that we had</text><text start="6376.619" dur="3.181">seen over the last 18 months you know</text><text start="6378.36" dur="3.48">some of it</text><text start="6379.8" dur="3.48">um you know macroeconomic induced some</text><text start="6381.84" dur="3.66">of it&amp;#39;s specific some of it</text><text start="6383.28" dur="4.14">competitively induced some of it</text><text start="6385.5" dur="4.44">um just because of bad decisions right</text><text start="6387.42" dur="4.5">or things that we got wrong</text><text start="6389.94" dur="3.48">um I know I just I decided that we</text><text start="6391.92" dur="3.239">needed to get to a point where we were a</text><text start="6393.42" dur="3.9">lot leaner and</text><text start="6395.159" dur="3.901">but look I mean but then okay it&amp;#39;s one</text><text start="6397.32" dur="3.48">thing to do that to like decide that at</text><text start="6399.06" dur="3.42">a high level then the question is how do</text><text start="6400.8" dur="4.74">you execute that as compassionately as</text><text start="6402.48" dur="5.159">possible and there&amp;#39;s no good way</text><text start="6405.54" dur="3.599">um there&amp;#39;s no perfect way for sure and</text><text start="6407.639" dur="5.641">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be tough no matter</text><text start="6409.139" dur="5.761">what but I you know as a leadership team</text><text start="6413.28" dur="3.72">here we&amp;#39;ve certainly spent a lot of time</text><text start="6414.9" dur="5.46">just thinking okay given that this is a</text><text start="6417" dur="4.86">thing that sucks like what is the most</text><text start="6420.36" dur="3">compassionate way that we can do this</text><text start="6421.86" dur="3.66">and um</text><text start="6423.36" dur="4.379">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve tried to do and</text><text start="6425.52" dur="6.3">you mentioned there there&amp;#39;s an increased</text><text start="6427.739" dur="7.321">focus on uh engineering on Tech so</text><text start="6431.82" dur="4.62">technology teams Tech Focus teams on</text><text start="6435.06" dur="2.639">Building Products</text><text start="6436.44" dur="4.699">that</text><text start="6437.699" dur="3.44">yeah I mean I I wanted to</text><text start="6441.179" dur="5.161">I want to empower</text><text start="6443.699" dur="5.46">Engineers more the people are building</text><text start="6446.34" dur="4.68">things the tech the technical teams</text><text start="6449.159" dur="3.96">um</text><text start="6451.02" dur="3.78">part of that is making sure</text><text start="6453.119" dur="3.841">that the people are building things</text><text start="6454.8" dur="4.5">aren&amp;#39;t just at like the leaf nodes of</text><text start="6456.96" dur="4.62">the organization I don&amp;#39;t want like</text><text start="6459.3" dur="3.78">eight levels of management and then</text><text start="6461.58" dur="3.48">the people actually doing the work so</text><text start="6463.08" dur="3.42">yeah we made changes to make it set you</text><text start="6465.06" dur="3.179">have individual contributor Engineers</text><text start="6466.5" dur="3.719">reporting at almost every level up the</text><text start="6468.239" dur="3.301">stack which is important because you</text><text start="6470.219" dur="2.821">know you&amp;#39;re running a company one of the</text><text start="6471.54" dur="4.199">big questions is</text><text start="6473.04" dur="4.92">you know latency of of information that</text><text start="6475.739" dur="4.561">you get you know we talked about this a</text><text start="6477.96" dur="3.38">bit earlier in terms of kind of the joy</text><text start="6480.3" dur="3.3">of of</text><text start="6481.34" dur="3.94">in the the feedback that you get doing</text><text start="6483.6" dur="4.139">something like Jiu Jitsu compared to</text><text start="6485.28" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re running a long-term project but</text><text start="6487.739" dur="2.94">I actually think part of the art of</text><text start="6489.42" dur="3">running a company is trying to</text><text start="6490.679" dur="3.661">constantly</text><text start="6492.42" dur="3.239">re-engineer it so that your feedback</text><text start="6494.34" dur="3.24">loops get shorter so you can learn</text><text start="6495.659" dur="3.721">faster and part of the way that you do</text><text start="6497.58" dur="3.059">that is by I kind of think that every</text><text start="6499.38" dur="2.88">every layer that you have in the</text><text start="6500.639" dur="2.401">organization</text><text start="6502.26" dur="2.939">um</text><text start="6503.04" dur="4.32">means that information might not need to</text><text start="6505.199" dur="3.841">get reviewed before it it goes to you</text><text start="6507.36" dur="3.24">and I think you know making a sense of</text><text start="6509.04" dur="4.32">people doing the work are as close as</text><text start="6510.6" dur="5.34">possible to you as possible is is as is</text><text start="6513.36" dur="4.859">pretty important so there&amp;#39;s that and I</text><text start="6515.94" dur="3.96">think over time companies just build up</text><text start="6518.219" dur="3.661">very large</text><text start="6519.9" dur="4.319">support functions that are not doing the</text><text start="6521.88" dur="4.38">kind of core technical work and those</text><text start="6524.219" dur="3.361">functions are very important but I think</text><text start="6526.26" dur="3.959">having them in the right proportion is</text><text start="6527.58" dur="5.52">is important and if um</text><text start="6530.219" dur="5.4">if you you try to do good work but you</text><text start="6533.1" dur="4.559">don&amp;#39;t have you know the right you know</text><text start="6535.619" dur="3.781">marketing team or</text><text start="6537.659" dur="3.48">um or the right legal advice like you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="6539.4" dur="4.44">gonna you know make some pretty big</text><text start="6541.139" dur="5.421">blunders but um but at the same time if</text><text start="6543.84" dur="6">you have you know if if you just like</text><text start="6546.56" dur="6.46">have too big of of things and and some</text><text start="6549.84" dur="6.42">of these support roles then that might</text><text start="6553.02" dur="5.4">make it so things are just move a lot</text><text start="6556.26" dur="3.78">um maybe you&amp;#39;re too conservative or you</text><text start="6558.42" dur="3.719">you move a lot slower</text><text start="6560.04" dur="3.96">um uh then then you should otherwise</text><text start="6562.139" dur="2.761">introduce those are just examples but</text><text start="6564" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s um</text><text start="6564.9" dur="3.9">but how do you find that balance it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6567.06" dur="3.48">really tough yeah no but that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="6568.8" dur="3.6">constant equilibrium that you&amp;#39;re that</text><text start="6570.54" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re searching for yeah how many</text><text start="6572.4" dur="3.719">managers to have what are the pros and</text><text start="6574.44" dur="3.779">cons of managers</text><text start="6576.119" dur="3.181">well I mean I I believe a lot in</text><text start="6578.219" dur="2.761">management I think there are some people</text><text start="6579.3" dur="3.72">who think that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter as much</text><text start="6580.98" dur="3.42">but look I mean we have a lot of younger</text><text start="6583.02" dur="3.84">people at the company for him this is</text><text start="6584.4" dur="4.319">their first job and you know people need</text><text start="6586.86" dur="3.48">to grow and learn in their career and</text><text start="6588.719" dur="3.42">like that all that stuff is important</text><text start="6590.34" dur="3.42">but here&amp;#39;s one mathematical way to look</text><text start="6592.139" dur="4.801">at it</text><text start="6593.76" dur="4.62">um you know at the beginning of this we</text><text start="6596.94" dur="4.259">um</text><text start="6598.38" dur="5.04">I asked our our people team what was the</text><text start="6601.199" dur="4.261">average number of of reports that a</text><text start="6603.42" dur="5.34">manager had and I think it was it was</text><text start="6605.46" dur="5.58">around three maybe three to four but</text><text start="6608.76" dur="5.7">closer to three I was like wow like a</text><text start="6611.04" dur="5.52">manager can you know best practices that</text><text start="6614.46" dur="3.48">person can can manage you know seven or</text><text start="6616.56" dur="2.76">eight people</text><text start="6617.94" dur="3">um but there was a reason why it was</text><text start="6619.32" dur="4.319">closer to three it was because we were</text><text start="6620.94" dur="4.799">growing so quickly right and when you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="6623.639" dur="4.681">hiring so many people so quickly</text><text start="6625.739" dur="5.581">then that means that you need managers</text><text start="6628.32" dur="4.379">who have capacity to onboard new people</text><text start="6631.32" dur="2.94">um and also if you have a new manager</text><text start="6632.699" dur="2.94">you may not want to have them have seven</text><text start="6634.26" dur="4.02">direct reports immediately because you</text><text start="6635.639" dur="4.381">want them to ramp up but the thing is</text><text start="6638.28" dur="3.66">going forward I don&amp;#39;t want us to</text><text start="6640.02" dur="3.78">actually hire that many people that</text><text start="6641.94" dur="3.42">quickly right so I I actually think</text><text start="6643.8" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ll just do better work if we have</text><text start="6645.36" dur="3.9">more constraints and we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="6647.4" dur="3.48">um you know leaner as an organization so</text><text start="6649.26" dur="3.479">in a world where we&amp;#39;re not adding so</text><text start="6650.88" dur="3.839">many people as quickly</text><text start="6652.739" dur="3.781">is it as valuable to have a lot of</text><text start="6654.719" dur="3.96">managers who have extra capacity waiting</text><text start="6656.52" dur="3.84">for new people no right so</text><text start="6658.679" dur="3.601">um so now we can we could sort of</text><text start="6660.36" dur="3.779">defragment the organization and get to a</text><text start="6662.28" dur="3.48">place where the average is closer to</text><text start="6664.139" dur="3.6">that seven or eight</text><text start="6665.76" dur="4.02">um and it&amp;#39;s it just ends up being a</text><text start="6667.739" dur="4.621">somewhat more kind of compact management</text><text start="6669.78" dur="4.8">structure which um you know decreases</text><text start="6672.36" dur="4.02">the latency on on information going up</text><text start="6674.58" dur="3.36">and down the chain and</text><text start="6676.38" dur="3.06">um and I think empowers people more but</text><text start="6677.94" dur="4.14">I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s an example that I</text><text start="6679.44" dur="5.4">think it doesn&amp;#39;t kind of undervalue the</text><text start="6682.08" dur="5.52">importance of management and and the</text><text start="6684.84" dur="4.74">um kind of the personal</text><text start="6687.6" dur="3.48">growth or coaching that people need in</text><text start="6689.58" dur="3.3">order to do their jobs well it&amp;#39;s just I</text><text start="6691.08" dur="3.3">think realistically we&amp;#39;re just not going</text><text start="6692.88" dur="2.4">to hire as many people going forward so</text><text start="6694.38" dur="3.839">I think that you need a different</text><text start="6695.28" dur="5.58">structure this whole this whole</text><text start="6698.219" dur="4.141">incredible hierarchy and network of</text><text start="6700.86" dur="5.52">humans that make up a company is</text><text start="6702.36" dur="7.2">fascinating oh yeah yeah how do you uh</text><text start="6706.38" dur="5.58">hire great teams how do you hire great</text><text start="6709.56" dur="4.8">now with the focus on engineering and</text><text start="6711.96" dur="3.719">Technical teams how do you hire great</text><text start="6714.36" dur="4.98">engineers</text><text start="6715.679" dur="6.121">and uh great members of technical teams</text><text start="6719.34" dur="5.779">well you&amp;#39;re asking how you select or how</text><text start="6721.8" dur="6.72">you attract them both but select I think</text><text start="6725.119" dur="5.981">uh I think attract is work on cool stuff</text><text start="6728.52" dur="4.44">and have a vision I think that&amp;#39;s right</text><text start="6731.1" dur="2.76">and and have a track record that people</text><text start="6732.96" dur="3.84">think you&amp;#39;re actually gonna be able to</text><text start="6733.86" dur="5.52">do it yeah to me the select is seems</text><text start="6736.8" dur="5.399">like more of the art form more of the</text><text start="6739.38" dur="5.52">tricky thing yeah do you select the</text><text start="6742.199" dur="4.381">people that fit the culture and can get</text><text start="6744.9" dur="3.9">integrated the most effectively and so</text><text start="6746.58" dur="4.44">on and maybe yeah especially when</text><text start="6748.8" dur="6.359">they&amp;#39;re young to see like</text><text start="6751.02" dur="5.88">to see the magic through the through the</text><text start="6755.159" dur="3.181">resumes to the paperwork and all this</text><text start="6756.9" dur="3.86">kind of stuff to see that there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="6758.34" dur="4.379">special human there that would do like</text><text start="6760.76" dur="4.12">incredible work</text><text start="6762.719" dur="4.861">so there are lots of different</text><text start="6764.88" dur="4.98">cuts on this question I mean I think</text><text start="6767.58" dur="5.28">when an organization is growing quickly</text><text start="6769.86" dur="5.46">one of the big questions that teams face</text><text start="6772.86" dur="5.7">is do I hire this person who&amp;#39;s in front</text><text start="6775.32" dur="5.399">of me now because they seem good or</text><text start="6778.56" dur="4.02">do I hold out to get someone who&amp;#39;s even</text><text start="6780.719" dur="4.02">better and</text><text start="6782.58" dur="5.579">the heuristic that I always</text><text start="6784.739" dur="6.42">focused on for myself and my own kind of</text><text start="6788.159" dur="4.381">direct hiring that I that I think works</text><text start="6791.159" dur="3.421">so when you when you recurse it through</text><text start="6792.54" dur="4.26">the organization is that you should only</text><text start="6794.58" dur="4.079">hire someone to be on your team if you</text><text start="6796.8" dur="3.899">would be happy working for them in an</text><text start="6798.659" dur="3.781">alternate universe then</text><text start="6800.699" dur="3.061">something that that kind of works and</text><text start="6802.44" dur="3.6">you know that&amp;#39;s basically how I&amp;#39;ve tried</text><text start="6803.76" dur="4.56">to build my team it&amp;#39;s you know I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="6806.04" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m not in a rush to not be running the</text><text start="6808.32" dur="3.24">company but I think in an alternate</text><text start="6810" dur="3.06">universe where one of these other folks</text><text start="6811.56" dur="3.48">was running the company I&amp;#39;d be happy to</text><text start="6813.06" dur="4.5">work for them I feel like I&amp;#39;d learn from</text><text start="6815.04" dur="4.02">them I respect their kind of General</text><text start="6817.56" dur="3.42">judgment</text><text start="6819.06" dur="3.54">um they&amp;#39;re all very insightful they have</text><text start="6820.98" dur="3.659">good values</text><text start="6822.6" dur="4.8">um and and I think that that gives you</text><text start="6824.639" dur="4.621">some rubric for</text><text start="6827.4" dur="3.12">you can apply that at every layer and I</text><text start="6829.26" dur="3.24">think if you apply that at every layer</text><text start="6830.52" dur="4.08">in the organization then you&amp;#39;ll have a</text><text start="6832.5" dur="3.96">pretty strong organization</text><text start="6834.6" dur="3.48">um</text><text start="6836.46" dur="3.42">okay in an organization that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="6838.08" dur="3.72">growing as quickly the questions might</text><text start="6839.88" dur="3.839">be a little different though</text><text start="6841.8" dur="3.3">um and there</text><text start="6843.719" dur="3.781">you asked about young people</text><text start="6845.1" dur="4.5">specifically like people out of college</text><text start="6847.5" dur="5.4">and one of the things that we see</text><text start="6849.6" dur="5.94">is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a pretty basic lesson but</text><text start="6852.9" dur="4.739">like we have a much better sense of who</text><text start="6855.54" dur="4.139">the best people are who have interned at</text><text start="6857.639" dur="4.441">the company for a couple of months then</text><text start="6859.679" dur="4.98">by looking at them at at kind of a</text><text start="6862.08" dur="4.86">resume or short or a short um interview</text><text start="6864.659" dur="3.781">Loop and obviously the in-person field</text><text start="6866.94" dur="3.299">that you get from someone probably tells</text><text start="6868.44" dur="3.779">you more than the resume</text><text start="6870.239" dur="5.281">um and you can do some basic skills</text><text start="6872.219" dur="5.281">assessment but a lot of the stuff really</text><text start="6875.52" dur="6.3">just is cultural people thrive in</text><text start="6877.5" dur="6.06">different environments and um and</text><text start="6881.82" dur="5.1">on different teams even within a</text><text start="6883.56" dur="5.579">specific company and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like the</text><text start="6886.92" dur="4.62">people who come for even a short period</text><text start="6889.139" dur="4.141">of time over a summer who do a great job</text><text start="6891.54" dur="3.42">here you know that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text><text start="6893.28" dur="3.24">great if they if they came and joined</text><text start="6894.96" dur="3.3">full time and that&amp;#39;s you know one of the</text><text start="6896.52" dur="3.9">reasons why we&amp;#39;ve invested so much in</text><text start="6898.26" dur="4.32">internship is um</text><text start="6900.42" dur="4.68">is basically just it&amp;#39;s a very useful</text><text start="6902.58" dur="3.659">sorting function both for us and for the</text><text start="6905.1" dur="3.3">people who want to try out the company</text><text start="6906.239" dur="4.681">you mentioned in person what do you</text><text start="6908.4" dur="4.38">think about remote work a topic that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6910.92" dur="4.02">been discussed extensively because of</text><text start="6912.78" dur="5.28">the over the past few years because of</text><text start="6914.94" dur="4.62">the pandemic yeah I mean I think it&amp;#39;s I</text><text start="6918.06" dur="3">mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a thing that&amp;#39;s here to</text><text start="6919.56" dur="3.78">stay</text><text start="6921.06" dur="5.94">um but I think that there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6923.34" dur="5.7">value in both right it&amp;#39;s not um</text><text start="6927" dur="3.48">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to run a fully</text><text start="6929.04" dur="3.48">remote company</text><text start="6930.48" dur="4.08">yet at least I think there&amp;#39;s an asterisk</text><text start="6932.52" dur="3.48">on that which is that which is that some</text><text start="6934.56" dur="3.72">of the other stuff you&amp;#39;re working on</text><text start="6936" dur="4.619">yeah yeah exactly it&amp;#39;s like all the all</text><text start="6938.28" dur="4.379">the um you know metaverse work and the</text><text start="6940.619" dur="3.721">the ability to be to feel like you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="6942.659" dur="4.201">truly present</text><text start="6944.34" dur="5.399">no matter where you are I think once you</text><text start="6946.86" dur="4.319">have that all dialed in then we may you</text><text start="6949.739" dur="3.121">know one day reach a point where it</text><text start="6951.179" dur="3.54">really just doesn&amp;#39;t matter as much where</text><text start="6952.86" dur="2.64">you are physically</text><text start="6954.719" dur="3.5">um</text><text start="6955.5" dur="2.719">but</text><text start="6958.92" dur="4.08">I don&amp;#39;t know today it today it still</text><text start="6961.32" dur="3.899">does right so</text><text start="6963" dur="4.739">yeah for people who there are all these</text><text start="6965.219" dur="3.601">people who have special skills and want</text><text start="6967.739" dur="3.241">to live in a place where we don&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="6968.82" dur="4.2">an office or are we better off having</text><text start="6970.98" dur="3.719">them in the company absolutely right and</text><text start="6973.02" dur="4.86">are a lot of people who work at the</text><text start="6974.699" dur="4.44">company for several years and then you</text><text start="6977.88" dur="2.88">know build up the relationships</text><text start="6979.139" dur="2.701">internally</text><text start="6980.76" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="6981.84" dur="3.48">and kind of have the trust and have a</text><text start="6983.58" dur="3.36">sense of how the company Works can they</text><text start="6985.32" dur="3.419">go work remotely now if they want and</text><text start="6986.94" dur="3.12">still do it as effectively and we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="6988.739" dur="2.4">done all these studies that show it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="6990.06" dur="3.179">like okay does that affect their</text><text start="6991.139" dur="4.801">performance it does not</text><text start="6993.239" dur="4.261">um but you know for the new folks who</text><text start="6995.94" dur="2.699">are joining</text><text start="6997.5" dur="2.639">um and</text><text start="6998.639" dur="3.48">for people who are earlier in their</text><text start="7000.139" dur="3.48">career and you know need to learn how to</text><text start="7002.119" dur="3.841">solve certain problems and need to get</text><text start="7003.619" dur="4.161">ramped up on the culture</text><text start="7005.96" dur="4.199">um you know when you&amp;#39;re working through</text><text start="7007.78" dur="4.06">really complicated problems where you</text><text start="7010.159" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t just want to sit in the you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="7011.84" dur="3.42">just want the formal meeting but you</text><text start="7013.159" dur="3.241">want to be able to like brainstorm when</text><text start="7015.26" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re walking in the hallway together</text><text start="7016.4" dur="3.54">after the meeting</text><text start="7018.32" dur="3.12">um I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s like we just</text><text start="7019.94" dur="5.36">haven&amp;#39;t replaced the</text><text start="7021.44" dur="3.86">uh the the kind of in-person</text><text start="7025.82" dur="4.859">Dynamics there yet with with anything</text><text start="7028.28" dur="4.5">remote yet so yeah there&amp;#39;s a magic to</text><text start="7030.679" dur="3.781">the in person that uh we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text><text start="7032.78" dur="3.3">this a little bit more but I&amp;#39;m really</text><text start="7034.46" dur="3.54">excited by the possibilities of the next</text><text start="7036.08" dur="4.619">two years in virtual reality and mixed</text><text start="7038" dur="5.699">reality that are possible with high</text><text start="7040.699" dur="5.52">resolution scans I mean uh</text><text start="7043.699" dur="5.04">I as a person who loves in-person</text><text start="7046.219" dur="5.641">interaction like these podcasts in</text><text start="7048.739" dur="5.341">person it would be incredible to achieve</text><text start="7051.86" dur="4.62">the level of realism I&amp;#39;ve gotten the</text><text start="7054.08" dur="6">chance to witness but let me</text><text start="7056.48" dur="5.159">ask about that yeah I got a chance to</text><text start="7060.08" dur="3.96">look at</text><text start="7061.639" dur="5.401">the quest 3 headset</text><text start="7064.04" dur="5.42">and it is amazing</text><text start="7067.04" dur="5.28">um you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve announced it</text><text start="7069.46" dur="4.9">it&amp;#39;s uh you&amp;#39;ll get some more details in</text><text start="7072.32" dur="3.66">the fall maybe releasing the when is it</text><text start="7074.36" dur="3">getting released again I forgot you you</text><text start="7075.98" dur="2.58">mentioned we&amp;#39;ll give more details to</text><text start="7077.36" dur="3.5">connect okay but but it&amp;#39;s coming it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7078.56" dur="8.52">coming this fall okay</text><text start="7080.86" dur="8.14">so uh it&amp;#39;s uh priced at uh 4.99</text><text start="7087.08" dur="3.9">what features are you most excited about</text><text start="7089" dur="4.26">there they&amp;#39;re basically two big new</text><text start="7090.98" dur="4.92">things that we&amp;#39;ve added to Quest three a</text><text start="7093.26" dur="4.979">request two the first is high resolution</text><text start="7095.9" dur="6.54">mixed reality</text><text start="7098.239" dur="6.36">um and the the basic idea here is that</text><text start="7102.44" dur="5.58">you can think about virtual reality as</text><text start="7104.599" dur="5.1">you have the headset and like all the</text><text start="7108.02" dur="4.02">pixels are virtual and you&amp;#39;re basically</text><text start="7109.699" dur="5.161">like immersed in a different world</text><text start="7112.04" dur="4.139">mixed reality is where you see the</text><text start="7114.86" dur="2.819">physical world around you and you can</text><text start="7116.179" dur="3.841">place virtual objects in it whether</text><text start="7117.679" dur="4.341">that&amp;#39;s a screen to watch a movie</text><text start="7120.02" dur="4.44">or a projection of your virtual desktop</text><text start="7122.02" dur="3.82">or you&amp;#39;re playing a game where like</text><text start="7124.46" dur="3.06">zombies are coming out through the wall</text><text start="7125.84" dur="3.12">and you need to shoot them</text><text start="7127.52" dur="2.88">um or you know we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="7128.96" dur="2.88">playing Dungeons and Dragons or some</text><text start="7130.4" dur="2.94">board game and we just have a virtual</text><text start="7131.84" dur="3.24">version of the board in front of us</text><text start="7133.34" dur="4.08">while we&amp;#39;re sitting here</text><text start="7135.08" dur="5.039">um all that&amp;#39;s possible in mixed reality</text><text start="7137.42" dur="4.5">and I think that that is going to be the</text><text start="7140.119" dur="3.781">next big capability on top of virtual</text><text start="7141.92" dur="5.4">reality it is done</text><text start="7143.9" dur="6.779">so well I have to say as a person who</text><text start="7147.32" dur="6.72">experienced it today with zombies having</text><text start="7150.679" dur="5.341">a full awareness of the environment and</text><text start="7154.04" dur="3.659">integrating that environment in the way</text><text start="7156.02" dur="4.199">they run at you while they try to kill</text><text start="7157.699" dur="4.201">you so it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s just the mixed</text><text start="7160.219" dur="3.96">reality the pass-through is really</text><text start="7161.9" dur="5.52">really really well done and the fact</text><text start="7164.179" dur="5.821">that it&amp;#39;s only 500 is really it&amp;#39;s uh</text><text start="7167.42" dur="4.44">well done thank you I mean I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m super</text><text start="7170" dur="6.96">excited about it I mean our</text><text start="7171.86" dur="7.62">and we put a lot of work into making</text><text start="7176.96" dur="4.32">the device both as good as possible and</text><text start="7179.48" dur="4.139">as affordable as possible because a big</text><text start="7181.28" dur="4.5">part of our mission and Ethos here is we</text><text start="7183.619" dur="4.261">we want people to be able to connect</text><text start="7185.78" dur="3.48">with each other we want to reach and we</text><text start="7187.88" dur="3.18">want to serve a lot of people right we</text><text start="7189.26" dur="3.359">want to bring this technology to to</text><text start="7191.06" dur="2.94">everyone right so we&amp;#39;re not just trying</text><text start="7192.619" dur="4.921">to serve</text><text start="7194" dur="5.4">like a you know an elite a wealthy crowd</text><text start="7197.54" dur="3.659">we we want to</text><text start="7199.4" dur="4.56">um we really want this to be accessible</text><text start="7201.199" dur="4.5">so that that is in a lot of ways an</text><text start="7203.96" dur="4.259">extremely hard technical problem because</text><text start="7205.699" dur="4.741">you know we don&amp;#39;t just have the ability</text><text start="7208.219" dur="3.721">to put an unlimited amount of hardware</text><text start="7210.44" dur="4.56">and thus we needed to basically deliver</text><text start="7211.94" dur="4.739">something that works really well but in</text><text start="7215" dur="4.56">an affordable package and we started</text><text start="7216.679" dur="4.98">with Quest Pro last year it was um</text><text start="7219.56" dur="3.48">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it was fifteen hundred</text><text start="7221.659" dur="3.121">dollars</text><text start="7223.04" dur="3.659">um and now we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve lowered the price</text><text start="7224.78" dur="5.58">to a thousand but in a lot of ways the</text><text start="7226.699" dur="5.341">mixed reality in quest 3 is it even even</text><text start="7230.36" dur="3.48">better and more advanced level than what</text><text start="7232.04" dur="4.02">we were able to deliver in quest Pro so</text><text start="7233.84" dur="4.799">I&amp;#39;m really proud of where we are with</text><text start="7236.06" dur="4.2">with um with Quest 3 on that it&amp;#39;s gonna</text><text start="7238.639" dur="4.08">work with all of the virtual reality</text><text start="7240.26" dur="4.14">titles and everything that that existed</text><text start="7242.719" dur="3.661">there so people who want to play fully</text><text start="7244.4" dur="4.56">immersive Games Social experiences</text><text start="7246.38" dur="4.56">Fitness all that stuff will will work</text><text start="7248.96" dur="3.3">but now you&amp;#39;ll also get mixed reality</text><text start="7250.94" dur="2.04">too</text><text start="7252.26" dur="2.399">um</text><text start="7252.98" dur="3.96">which I think people really like because</text><text start="7254.659" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s um sometimes you want to be super</text><text start="7256.94" dur="5.1">immersed in a game but a lot of the time</text><text start="7260.179" dur="3.48">especially when you&amp;#39;re moving around if</text><text start="7262.04" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re active like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="7263.659" dur="3.781">some Fitness experience</text><text start="7265.76" dur="3.899">um you know

able to see the room</text><text start="7270.679" dur="2.94">around you so that way you know that</text><text start="7272.06" dur="3.059">like I&amp;#39;m not gonna punch a lamp or</text><text start="7273.619" dur="2.881">something like that</text><text start="7275.119" dur="2.341">um and I don&amp;#39;t know if you got to play</text><text start="7276.5" dur="2.639">with this experience but if you</text><text start="7277.46" dur="3.179">basically have the I mean it&amp;#39;s just sort</text><text start="7279.139" dur="4.321">of like a fun little little demo that we</text><text start="7280.639" dur="5.04">put together but it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s like you</text><text start="7283.46" dur="4.02">just you know we&amp;#39;re like in a conference</text><text start="7285.679" dur="4.261">room or your living room and you you</text><text start="7287.48" dur="3.78">have um the guy there and you&amp;#39;re boxing</text><text start="7289.94" dur="3.06">him and you&amp;#39;re fighting him and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7291.26" dur="3.359">like all the other people are there too</text><text start="7293" dur="4.619">I got a chance to do that yeah and all</text><text start="7294.619" dur="5.52">the people are there uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7297.619" dur="3.661">like that guy&amp;#39;s right there yeah it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7300.139" dur="3.121">like it&amp;#39;s right there and the other</text><text start="7301.28" dur="3.6">human the the path you&amp;#39;re seeing them</text><text start="7303.26" dur="3.24">also they can cheer you on they can make</text><text start="7304.88" dur="4.68">fun of you if they&amp;#39;re anything like</text><text start="7306.5" dur="6.48">friends of mine and then just it yeah it</text><text start="7309.56" dur="6">it it it&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="7312.98" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s a really compelling experience I</text><text start="7315.56" dur="3.78">mean VR is really interesting too but</text><text start="7317.3" dur="4.14">this is something else almost this is</text><text start="7319.34" dur="4.08">this is because integrated into your</text><text start="7321.44" dur="4.799">life into your world</text><text start="7323.42" dur="4.679">yeah and it so I think it&amp;#39;s a completely</text><text start="7326.239" dur="4.44">new capability that will unlock a lot of</text><text start="7328.099" dur="3.841">different content and I think it&amp;#39;ll also</text><text start="7330.679" dur="2.821">just make the experience more</text><text start="7331.94" dur="4.38">comfortable for a set of people who</text><text start="7333.5" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t want to have only fully immersive</text><text start="7336.32" dur="3.18">experiences I think if you want</text><text start="7337.52" dur="3">experiences where you&amp;#39;re grounded in you</text><text start="7339.5" dur="2.94">know your living room in the physical</text><text start="7340.52" dur="3.06">world around you now you&amp;#39;ll be able to</text><text start="7342.44" dur="2.58">have that too</text><text start="7343.58" dur="5.46">and I think that that&amp;#39;s pretty exciting</text><text start="7345.02" dur="6.78">I really liked how it added Windows to a</text><text start="7349.04" dur="4.26">room with no windows yeah me as a person</text><text start="7351.8" dur="3.18">you see the aquarium one where you could</text><text start="7353.3" dur="4.02">see the shark swim up or was that just</text><text start="7354.98" dur="3.48">the zombie one yeah but it&amp;#39;s still you</text><text start="7357.32" dur="2.7">know you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text><text start="7358.46" dur="4.32">want Windows added to your living room</text><text start="7360.02" dur="4.679">where Zombies come out of but yeah that</text><text start="7362.78" dur="4.56">game it&amp;#39;s yeah yeah yeah I enjoyed it</text><text start="7364.699" dur="4.801">because you could see the nature outside</text><text start="7367.34" dur="4.319">and uh me as a person that doesn&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="7369.5" dur="6.119">Windows it&amp;#39;s just nice to have nature</text><text start="7371.659" dur="6.301">yeah well if even if it&amp;#39;s a mixed</text><text start="7375.619" dur="3.961">reality setting it was it&amp;#39;s cut like</text><text start="7377.96" dur="4.679">there was a I know it&amp;#39;s a zombie game</text><text start="7379.58" dur="5.159">but there&amp;#39;s a Zen nature Zen aspect to</text><text start="7382.639" dur="5.52">being able to look outside and alter</text><text start="7384.739" dur="5.46">your environment as you know it</text><text start="7388.159" dur="3.661">yeah in um</text><text start="7390.199" dur="3.061">there will probably be better more Zen</text><text start="7391.82" dur="2.879">ways to do that than this is the game</text><text start="7393.26" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re describing but you&amp;#39;re right that</text><text start="7394.699" dur="5.101">the the basic idea of of sort of having</text><text start="7397.82" dur="3.96">your physical environment on</text><text start="7399.8" dur="3.18">pass-through but then being able to</text><text start="7401.78" dur="2.939">bring in</text><text start="7402.98" dur="3.719">different elements</text><text start="7404.719" dur="4.681">extern I mean it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="7406.699" dur="3.841">be super powerful and in some ways I</text><text start="7409.4" dur="3.54">think that these are</text><text start="7410.54" dur="4.74">mixed reality is also a predecessor to</text><text start="7412.94" dur="4.5">eventually we will get AR glasses that</text><text start="7415.28" dur="4.859">are not kind of the goggles form factor</text><text start="7417.44" dur="4.92">of the current generation of of headsets</text><text start="7420.139" dur="3.841">that that people are making</text><text start="7422.36" dur="3.6">um but I think a lot of the experiences</text><text start="7423.98" dur="3.659">that developers are making for mixed</text><text start="7425.96" dur="3.179">reality of basically you just have a</text><text start="7427.639" dur="3.48">kind of a hologram that you&amp;#39;re putting</text><text start="7429.139" dur="4.56">in the world will hopefully apply once</text><text start="7431.119" dur="4.08">we once we get the the air glasses too</text><text start="7433.699" dur="3.781">now that&amp;#39;s got its own whole set of</text><text start="7435.199" dur="4.02">challenges and it&amp;#39;s um well the headset</text><text start="7437.48" dur="4.739">is already smaller than the previous</text><text start="7439.219" dur="4.141">version oh yeah 40 thinner and the other</text><text start="7442.219" dur="2.761">thing that I think is good about it it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7443.36" dur="2.46">yeah so mixed reality was the first big</text><text start="7444.98" dur="4.86">thing</text><text start="7445.82" dur="5.819">the second is it&amp;#39;s just a great VR</text><text start="7449.84" dur="4.259">headset it&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s got 2x the</text><text start="7451.639" dur="6.241">graphics processing power</text><text start="7454.099" dur="6.06">um 40 sharper screens 40 thinner more</text><text start="7457.88" dur="4.08">comfortable better strap architecture</text><text start="7460.159" dur="3.421">all the stuff that you know if you liked</text><text start="7461.96" dur="3.42">Quest 2 I think that this is just going</text><text start="7463.58" dur="3.059">to be it&amp;#39;s like all this all the content</text><text start="7465.38" dur="2.64">that you might have played in Quest 2 is</text><text start="7466.639" dur="3.781">just going to be sharper automatically</text><text start="7468.02" dur="3.599">and look better in this so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="7470.42" dur="3">um I think people are really gonna like</text><text start="7471.619" dur="6">it yeah so this fall</text><text start="7473.42" dur="7.02">at this fall I have to ask Apple just</text><text start="7477.619" dur="5.161">announced a mixed reality headset called</text><text start="7480.44" dur="3.239">Vision Pro for thirty five hundred</text><text start="7482.78" dur="3.6">dollars</text><text start="7483.679" dur="5.161">available in early 2024 what do you</text><text start="7486.38" dur="4.799">think about this headset</text><text start="7488.84" dur="4.14">well I saw the materials</text><text start="7491.179" dur="3.301">um when they launched I I haven&amp;#39;t gotten</text><text start="7492.98" dur="3">a chance to play with it yet so so so</text><text start="7494.48" dur="4.8">kind of take everything with a grain of</text><text start="7495.98" dur="4.86">salt but a few high-level thoughts I</text><text start="7499.28" dur="2.939">mean first</text><text start="7500.84" dur="4.5">um</text><text start="7502.219" dur="6.361">you know I do think that this is</text><text start="7505.34" dur="5.58">a certain level of validation for</text><text start="7508.58" dur="3.72">the category right where you know when</text><text start="7510.92" dur="3.54">we were the</text><text start="7512.3" dur="4.98">primary folks out there before saying</text><text start="7514.46" dur="4.62">hey I think that this you know virtual</text><text start="7517.28" dur="3.3">reality augmented reality mixed reality</text><text start="7519.08" dur="3.72">this is going to be a big part of the</text><text start="7520.58" dur="5.76">next Computing platform</text><text start="7522.8" dur="6.78">um I think having Apple come in</text><text start="7526.34" dur="4.92">and share that vision</text><text start="7529.58" dur="3.72">um</text><text start="7531.26" dur="3.959">will make a lot of people who are fans</text><text start="7533.3" dur="4.08">of their products</text><text start="7535.219" dur="3.721">um really consider that</text><text start="7537.38" dur="5.219">um and then</text><text start="7538.94" dur="4.44">you know of course the the 3 500 price</text><text start="7542.599" dur="2.701">um</text><text start="7543.38" dur="2.94">you know on the one hand I get it for</text><text start="7545.3" dur="2.7">with all the stuff that they&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="7546.32" dur="3.6">to pack in there on the other hand a lot</text><text start="7548" dur="3.06">of people aren&amp;#39;t going to find that to</text><text start="7549.92" dur="3.239">be affordable</text><text start="7551.06" dur="4.7">so I think there&amp;#39;s a chance that that</text><text start="7553.159" dur="5.701">them coming in actually increases demand</text><text start="7555.76" dur="5.08">for the overall space and that Quest 3</text><text start="7558.86" dur="4.14">is actually the primary beneficiary of</text><text start="7560.84" dur="5.7">that because a lot of the people who</text><text start="7563" dur="5.04">might say Hey you know this I think I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="7566.54" dur="3.78">going to give another consideration to</text><text start="7568.04" dur="4.559">this or you know now I understand maybe</text><text start="7570.32" dur="4.56">what mixed reality is more and in quest</text><text start="7572.599" dur="4.14">3 is the best one on the market that I</text><text start="7574.88" dur="3.719">can that I can afford</text><text start="7576.739" dur="4.021">um and it&amp;#39;s great also right it&amp;#39;s I</text><text start="7578.599" dur="3.841">think that that&amp;#39;s um and you know in our</text><text start="7580.76" dur="2.82">own way I think where there are a lot of</text><text start="7582.44" dur="2.46">features that we have where we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="7583.58" dur="3.9">leading on</text><text start="7584.9" dur="4.02">um so I think that that&amp;#39;s that that I</text><text start="7587.48" dur="3.36">think is going to be a very</text><text start="7588.92" dur="2.88">that could be quite good</text><text start="7590.84" dur="2.58">um</text><text start="7591.8" dur="3.54">and then obviously over time the</text><text start="7593.42" dur="4.14">companies are just focused on</text><text start="7595.34" dur="3.72">somewhat different things Red Apple has</text><text start="7597.56" dur="4.579">always</text><text start="7599.06" dur="7.02">um you know I think focused on building</text><text start="7602.139" dur="8.02">really kind of high-end things whereas</text><text start="7606.08" dur="5.82">our Focus has been on it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a</text><text start="7610.159" dur="4.201">we have a more democratic ethos we want</text><text start="7611.9" dur="4.259">to build things that are accessible to a</text><text start="7614.36" dur="4.319">wider number of people</text><text start="7616.159" dur="4.98">um you know we&amp;#39;ve sold tens of millions</text><text start="7618.679" dur="3.781">of quest devices</text><text start="7621.139" dur="4.08">um</text><text start="7622.46" dur="3.9">my understanding just based on rumors I</text><text start="7625.219" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t have any special knowledge on this</text><text start="7626.36" dur="4.319">is that apple is building about 1</text><text start="7628.219" dur="4.801">million of their of their device right</text><text start="7630.679" dur="5.281">so just in terms of like what you kind</text><text start="7633.02" dur="5.639">of expect in terms of sales numbers</text><text start="7635.96" dur="5.4">um I I just think that this is</text><text start="7638.659" dur="5.341">I mean Quest is is going to be the</text><text start="7641.36" dur="4.02">primary thing that people in in the</text><text start="7644" dur="2.52">market will continue using for the</text><text start="7645.38" dur="2.64">foreseeable future and then obviously</text><text start="7646.52" dur="3">over the long term it&amp;#39;s up to the</text><text start="7648.02" dur="2.76">companies to see how how well we each</text><text start="7649.52" dur="3">executed the different things that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="7650.78" dur="3.359">doing but we kind of commented from</text><text start="7652.52" dur="5.639">different places we&amp;#39;re very focused on</text><text start="7654.139" dur="5.1">social interaction communication</text><text start="7658.159" dur="3.421">um</text><text start="7659.239" dur="5.521">being more active right so Fitness</text><text start="7661.58" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s gaming there are those things</text><text start="7664.76" dur="4.02">um you know whereas I think a lot of the</text><text start="7666.38" dur="4.739">use cases that you saw in</text><text start="7668.78" dur="4.859">um in in Apple&amp;#39;s launch material were</text><text start="7671.119" dur="5.221">more around you know people sitting</text><text start="7673.639" dur="4.261">um you know people looking at screens</text><text start="7676.34" dur="3.54">um which are great I think that you will</text><text start="7677.9" dur="4.319">replace your laptop over time with with</text><text start="7679.88" dur="4.56">a with a headset but um but I think in</text><text start="7682.219" dur="4.741">terms of kind of how the different use</text><text start="7684.44" dur="4.199">cases that the companies are going after</text><text start="7686.96" dur="3.42">um and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re a bit</text><text start="7688.639" dur="4.321">different for for where we are right now</text><text start="7690.38" dur="3.96">yeah so they&amp;#39;re gaming wasn&amp;#39;t a big part</text><text start="7692.96" dur="3.239">of the presentation which is an</text><text start="7694.34" dur="5.7">interesting</text><text start="7696.199" dur="5.281">it feels like mixed reality gaming such</text><text start="7700.04" dur="3.84">a big part of that</text><text start="7701.48" dur="3.659">it was interesting to see it missing in</text><text start="7703.88" dur="3.54">the presentation well well I mean look</text><text start="7705.139" dur="4.261">there are certain design trade-offs in</text><text start="7707.42" dur="4.08">this where</text><text start="7709.4" dur="3.48">you know they I think they made this</text><text start="7711.5" dur="3.719">point about not wanting to have</text><text start="7712.88" dur="3.96">controllers which on the one hand</text><text start="7715.219" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s a certain Elegance about just</text><text start="7716.84" dur="5.16">being able to navigate the system with</text><text start="7719.239" dur="4.201">eye gaze and hand tracking and by the</text><text start="7722" dur="3.3">way you&amp;#39;ll be able to just navigate</text><text start="7723.44" dur="3">quest with your hands too if that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="7725.3" dur="2.399">you want</text><text start="7726.44" dur="4.799">um yeah one of the things I should</text><text start="7727.699" dur="6.361">mention is that the the capability from</text><text start="7731.239" dur="4.621">the cameras to uh with computer vision</text><text start="7734.06" dur="3.48">to detect certain aspects of the hand</text><text start="7735.86" dur="3.54">allowing you to have a controller that</text><text start="7737.54" dur="3.96">doesn&amp;#39;t have that ring thing yeah like</text><text start="7739.4" dur="4.319">the hand tracking in in quest three and</text><text start="7741.5" dur="4.92">the usual tracking is is a big step up</text><text start="7743.719" dur="3.42">from from the last generation</text><text start="7746.42" dur="2.4">um</text><text start="7747.139" dur="4.201">and one of the demos that we have is</text><text start="7748.82" dur="4.08">basically an MR experience teaching you</text><text start="7751.34" dur="2.819">how to play piano where it basically</text><text start="7752.9" dur="2.94">highlights the notes that you need to</text><text start="7754.159" dur="3.901">play and it&amp;#39;s like just all its hands</text><text start="7755.84" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s no controllers but</text><text start="7758.06" dur="3.72">I think if you care about gaming</text><text start="7760.28" dur="3.06">having</text><text start="7761.78" dur="3.72">um a controller</text><text start="7763.34" dur="5.04">allows you to have a more tactile feel</text><text start="7765.5" dur="5.94">and allows you to capture</text><text start="7768.38" dur="4.68">fine motor movement much more precisely</text><text start="7771.44" dur="3.12">than</text><text start="7773.06" dur="2.88">um than what you can do with hands</text><text start="7774.56" dur="3.539">without something that you&amp;#39;re touching</text><text start="7775.94" dur="4.44">so again I think it&amp;#39;s there are certain</text><text start="7778.099" dur="4.801">questions which are just around what use</text><text start="7780.38" dur="3.299">cases are you optimizing for</text><text start="7782.9" dur="3.18">um</text><text start="7783.679" dur="4.5">I I think if you want to play games then</text><text start="7786.08" dur="3.599">I think that that I think you want you</text><text start="7788.179" dur="4.381">want to design the system in a different</text><text start="7789.679" dur="4.801">way and and we&amp;#39;re more focused on on</text><text start="7792.56" dur="3.599">kind of social experiences entertainment</text><text start="7794.48" dur="2.34">experiences</text><text

different things like that</text><text start="7946.219" dur="4.141">um</text><text start="7947.42" dur="4.799">and that&amp;#39;s going to be a pretty big</text><text start="7950.36" dur="2.94">set of

dur="2.159">autonomy</text><text start="8104.98" dur="2.52">um</text><text start="8105.639" dur="3.901">we might develop these wildly</text><text start="8107.5" dur="4.56">intelligent systems that are

dur="3.841">the same way that our near cortex is</text><text start="8116.139" dur="5.281">sort of subservient and is used as a</text><text start="8118.54" dur="5.4">tool by our our kind of simple

start="8125.92" dur="3.9">intelligent systems that that have the</text><text start="8127.84" dur="4.2">capacity to think will will kind of act</text><text start="8129.82" dur="4.98">as that as sort of an extension of of</text><text start="8132.04" dur="4.5">the neocortex doing that so I think my</text><text start="8134.8" dur="4.74">own view is that</text><text start="8136.54" dur="6.78">where we really need to be careful is on</text><text start="8139.54" dur="5.94">the development of autonomy and how we</text><text start="8143.32" dur="3">think about that because</text><text start="8145.48" dur="2.82">um</text><text start="8146.32" dur="3.839">it&amp;#39;s actually the case that</text><text start="8148.3" dur="4.319">relatively simple and unintelligent</text><text start="8150.159"

that it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8156.219" dur="4.02">virus right it&amp;#39;s I mean like it could be</text><text start="8158.44" dur="2.94">simple computer code that is not</text><text

dur="4.981">without it being something that is more</text><text start="8287.139" dur="5.42">broadly available I think if you look</text><text start="8290.08" dur="2.479">through history</text><text start="8292.599" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s when there are these sort of like</text><text start="8294.639" dur="5.161">unipolar advances and things that in</text><text start="8298.179" dur="4.141">like

one of the</text><text start="8305.439" dur="4.08">reasons why I think open sources is is</text><text start="8307.24" dur="4.14">generally</text><text start="8309.519" dur="4.021">the right approach</text><text start="8311.38" dur="3.36">and you know I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8313.54" dur="2.34">categorically different question today</text><text start="8314.74" dur="2.819">when we&amp;#39;re not close to Super</text><text start="8315.88" dur="3.179">intelligence I think there&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="8317.559" dur="3.96">chance

of that is that that</text><text start="8328.059" dur="2.701">is</text><text start="8328.899" dur="4.561">you know I think one of the best ways to</text><text start="8330.76" dur="4.139">ensure that

to</text><text start="8336.639" dur="4.741">it it&amp;#39;s the scrutiny that that kind of</text><text start="8339.16" dur="4.14">comes with being with building an open</text><text start="8341.38"

start="8346.599" dur="4.221">um now you have the code out there so</text><text start="8349.059" dur="4.08">anyone can see the vulnerabilities</text><text start="8350.82" dur="4.18">anyone can can kind

to be a lot safer and</text><text start="8363.88" dur="3.42">more secure</text><text start="8365.559" dur="3.84">um so</text><text start="8367.3" dur="5.28">I think that there&amp;#39;s a

technology</text><text start="8388.96" dur="4.86">in a way that that strikes me as good</text><text start="8391.24" dur="4.92">value is to Aspire to so to you the</text><text start="8393.82" dur="4.619">risks there&amp;#39;s risks to open sourcing but</text><text start="8396.16" dur="5.22">the benefits outweigh the risks at the</text><text start="8398.439" dur="4.5">two it&amp;#39;s interesting I think the way you</text><text start="8401.38" dur="3.96">put it</text><text start="8402.939" dur="4.801">uh you put it well that there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8405.34" dur="5.519">different discussion now than when we</text><text start="8407.74" dur="5.46">get closer to the uh to development of</text><text start="8410.859" dur="5.04">super intelligence of of the benefits</text><text start="8413.2" dur="4.92">and risks of uh open sourcing yeah and</text><text start="8415.899" dur="4.561">to be clear I feel quite confident in</text><text start="8418.12" dur="6.42">the assessment that open sourcing models</text><text start="8420.46" dur="6.18">now is that positive I think there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8424.54" dur="3.72">good argument that in the future it will</text><text start="8426.64" dur="3.9">be too even as you get closer to Super</text><text start="8428.26" dur="4.02">intelligence but I&amp;#39;ve not I&amp;#39;m I</text><text start="8430.54" dur="3.24">certainly have not decided on that yet</text><text start="8432.28" dur="3.84">and I think that it becomes a somewhat</text><text start="8433.78" dur="3.6">more complex set of questions that I</text><text start="8436.12" dur="3.18">think people will have time to debate</text><text start="8437.38" dur="3.72">and will also be informed by what</text><text start="8439.3" dur="3">happens between now and then and to make</text><text start="8441.1" dur="3.24">those decisions we don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="8442.3" dur="4.019">necessarily just debate that in theory</text><text start="8444.34" dur="5.36">right now uh what year do you think</text><text start="8446.319" dur="3.381">we&amp;#39;ll have a super intelligence</text><text start="8449.859" dur="4.441">I don&amp;#39;t know I mean that&amp;#39;s pure</text><text start="8451.18" dur="4.32">speculation I think it&amp;#39;s uh I think it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8454.3" dur="2.519">very clear just taking a step back that</text><text start="8455.5" dur="3.78">we had a big breakthrough in the last</text><text start="8456.819" dur="4.981">year yes right where the the llms and</text><text start="8459.28" dur="4.619">diffusion models basically reached a a</text><text start="8461.8" dur="3.9">scale where they&amp;#39;re able to do some some</text><text start="8463.899" dur="2.941">pretty interesting things and then I</text><text start="8465.7" dur="4.68">think the question is what happens from</text><text start="8466.84" dur="5.519">here and just to paint the two extremes</text><text start="8470.38" dur="3.479">on the</text><text start="8472.359" dur="3.781">um</text><text start="8473.859" dur="4.321">on on one side it&amp;#39;s like okay we just</text><text start="8476.14" dur="3.48">had one breakthrough if we just have</text><text start="8478.18" dur="3.12">like another breakthrough like that or</text><text start="8479.62" dur="4.56">maybe two then we could have something</text><text start="8481.3" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s truly crazy right and and is like</text><text start="8484.18" dur="5.36">is um</text><text start="8486.46" dur="5.34">just like so much more advanced and and</text><text start="8489.54" dur="4.48">on that side of the argument it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="8491.8" dur="3.54">okay well maybe we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="8494.02" dur="3.419">um</text><text start="8495.34" dur="5.519">maybe we&amp;#39;re only a couple of big steps</text><text start="8497.439" dur="4.561">away from uh from from from reaching</text><text start="8500.859" dur="2.341">something that looks more like general</text><text start="8502" dur="3">intelligence</text><text start="8503.2" dur="3.72">okay that&amp;#39;s one that&amp;#39;s one side of the</text><text start="8505" dur="3.3">argument and the other side which is</text><text start="8506.92" dur="5.1">what we&amp;#39;ve historically seen a lot more</text><text start="8508.3" dur="5.28">is that a breakthrough leads to</text><text start="8512.02" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="8513.58" dur="5.04">you know in that in that Gartner hype</text><text start="8516.22" dur="3.84">cycle there&amp;#39;s like the hype and then</text><text start="8518.62" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s the trough of disillusionment</text><text start="8520.06" dur="4.2">after when like people think that</text><text start="8522.1" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s a chance that hey okay there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8524.26" dur="2.099">big breakthrough maybe we&amp;#39;re about to</text><text start="8525.28" dur="2.46">get another big breakthrough and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8526.359" dur="3.421">like actually you&amp;#39;re not about to get</text><text start="8527.74" dur="3.239">another breakthrough you&amp;#39;re maybe you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="8529.78" dur="3.96">actually just gonna have to sit with</text><text start="8530.979" dur="5.581">this one for a while and</text><text start="8533.74" dur="4.86">um and you know it could be</text><text start="8536.56" dur="3.78">it could be five years it could be ten</text><text start="8538.6" dur="2.7">years it could be 15 years until you</text><text start="8540.34" dur="3.78">figure out</text><text start="8541.3" dur="6.12">the um the kind of the next big thing</text><text start="8544.12" dur="4.68">that needs to get figured out and um but</text><text start="8547.42" dur="3.3">I think that the fact that we just had</text><text start="8548.8" dur="3.78">this breakthrough</text><text start="8550.72" dur="4.679">sort of makes sense that we&amp;#39;re at a</text><text start="8552.58" dur="5.819">point of almost a very wide error bars</text><text start="8555.399" dur="5.761">on what happens next yeah um I think the</text><text start="8558.399" dur="4.621">traditional technical view or the like</text><text start="8561.16" dur="3.659">looking at the industry</text><text start="8563.02" dur="2.94">would suggest that we&amp;#39;re not just going</text><text start="8564.819" dur="2.941">to stack</text><text start="8565.96" dur="3.42">in a like Breakthrough on top of</text><text start="8567.76" dur="4.5">breakthrough on top of breakthrough like</text><text start="8569.38" dur="5.64">every six months or something right now</text><text start="8572.26" dur="4.38">I think it it will I&amp;#39;m guessing I would</text><text start="8575.02" dur="5.16">guess that it will take some longer in</text><text start="8576.64" dur="5.58">between these but um</text><text start="8580.18" dur="3.66">I don&amp;#39;t know but I tend to be pretty</text><text start="8582.22" dur="3.179">optimistic about breakthroughs too so I</text><text start="8583.84" dur="3.42">mean so I think if you if you if you</text><text start="8585.399" dur="4.021">normalized for for my normal optimism</text><text start="8587.26" dur="3.78">then then maybe it would be even even</text><text start="8589.42" dur="4.26">slower than what I&amp;#39;m saying but but even</text><text start="8591.04" dur="3.96">within that like I&amp;#39;m not even opining on</text><text start="8593.68" dur="2.46">the question of how many breakthroughs</text><text start="8595" dur="3.84">are required to get to general</text><text start="8596.14" dur="4.92">intelligence because no one knows</text><text start="8598.84" dur="6">but this particular breakthrough was so</text><text start="8601.06" dur="6.96">such a small step that resulted in such</text><text start="8604.84" dur="5.82">a big leap in performance</text><text start="8608.02" dur="5.82">as experienced by human beings that it</text><text start="8610.66" dur="6.239">makes you think wow are we is as we</text><text start="8613.84" dur="6.12">stumble across this very open world of</text><text start="8616.899" dur="5.761">research where we stumble</text><text start="8619.96" dur="5.76">um across another thing that will have a</text><text start="8622.66" dur="6.84">giant leap of performance</text><text start="8625.72" dur="5.7">and also we don&amp;#39;t know exactly at which</text><text start="8629.5" dur="3.96">stage is it really going to be</text><text start="8631.42" dur="4.68">impressive because it feels like it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8633.46" dur="4.38">really encroaching on impressive levels</text><text start="8636.1" dur="3.96">of intelligence</text><text start="8637.84" dur="3.599">you still didn&amp;#39;t answer the question of</text><text start="8640.06" dur="3.18">what year we&amp;#39;re going to have super</text><text start="8641.439" dur="3.661">intelligence I&amp;#39;d like to hold you to</text><text start="8643.24" dur="4.02">that no I&amp;#39;m just kidding but is there</text><text start="8645.1" dur="3.36">something you could say about the</text><text start="8647.26" dur="4.86">timeline</text><text start="8648.46" dur="6.54">as you think about the development of</text><text start="8652.12" dur="6.359">um AGI super intelligence systems</text><text start="8655" dur="5.58">sure so I I still don&amp;#39;t think I have any</text><text start="8658.479" dur="3.96">particular Insight on when like a</text><text start="8660.58" dur="3.84">singular AI system that is a general</text><text start="8662.439" dur="4.861">intelligence will get created but I</text><text start="8664.42" dur="4.32">think the one thing that most people</text><text start="8667.3" dur="2.94">in the discourse that I&amp;#39;ve seen about</text><text start="8668.74" dur="5.04">this haven&amp;#39;t really grappled with is</text><text start="8670.24" dur="6.48">that we do seem to have</text><text start="8673.78" dur="4.44">organiz organizations and you know</text><text start="8676.72" dur="3.179">structures in the world that exhibit</text><text start="8678.22" dur="5.639">greater than human intelligence already</text><text start="8679.899" dur="5.941">so you know one example is a you know a</text><text start="8683.859" dur="4.62">company you know it acts as an entity it</text><text start="8685.84" dur="4.559">has you know singular brand</text><text start="8688.479" dur="4.621">um obviously it&amp;#39;s a collection of people</text><text start="8690.399" dur="4.46">but I I certainly hope that you know</text><text start="8693.1" dur="4.2">meta with tens of thousands of people</text><text start="8694.859" dur="4.241">make smarter decisions than one person</text><text start="8697.3" dur="3.12">but I think that would be pretty bad if</text><text start="8699.1" dur="2.339">it didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="8700.42" dur="3.899">um</text><text start="8701.439" dur="5.701">another example that I think is even</text><text start="8704.319" dur="4.861">more removed from kind of the way we</text><text start="8707.14" dur="4.56">think about like the personification of</text><text start="8709.18" dur="4.44">of um of intelligence which is often</text><text start="8711.7" dur="3">implied in some of these questions is</text><text start="8713.62" dur="4.08">think about something like the stock</text><text start="8714.7" dur="4.56">market where the the stock market is you</text><text start="8717.7" dur="3.36">know takes inputs it&amp;#39;s a distributed</text><text start="8719.26" dur="3.719">system it&amp;#39;s like the cybernetic organism</text><text start="8721.06" dur="3.72">that</text><text start="8722.979" dur="3.301">you know probably millions of people</text><text start="8724.78" dur="4.14">around the world</text><text start="8726.28" dur="4.38">are basically voting every day by</text><text start="8728.92" dur="4.32">choosing what to invest in</text><text start="8730.66" dur="6.659">but it&amp;#39;s basically this</text><text start="8733.24" dur="6.78">this organism or or structure that is</text><text start="8737.319" dur="5.821">smarter than any individual that we use</text><text start="8740.02" dur="6.72">to allocate Capital as efficiently as</text><text start="8743.14" dur="6.08">possible around the world and</text><text start="8746.74" dur="2.48">that</text><text start="8749.62" dur="3.98">this notion that there are already these</text><text start="8751.899" dur="6.481">cybernetic</text><text start="8753.6" dur="6.339">systems that are either melding</text><text start="8758.38" dur="3.54">the intelligence of multiple people</text><text start="8759.939" dur="5.581">together or melting the intelligence of</text><text start="8761.92" dur="5.82">multiple people and Technology together</text><text start="8765.52" dur="4.5">to form something which is</text><text start="8767.74" dur="5.28">dramatically more intelligent than any</text><text start="8770.02" dur="4.56">individual on the in the world</text><text start="8773.02" dur="4.2">um</text><text start="8774.58" dur="5.399">is something that seems to exist</text><text start="8777.22" dur="5.759">and that we seem to be able to harness</text><text start="8779.979" dur="4.801">in a productive way for our society</text><text start="8782.979" dur="4.261">is as long as we basically build these</text><text start="8784.78" dur="4.92">structures and balance with each other</text><text start="8787.24" dur="5.34">um so I don&amp;#39;t know I mean that that at</text><text start="8789.7" dur="4.38">least gives me hope that as we advance</text><text start="8792.58" dur="3.239">the technology and I don&amp;#39;t know how long</text><text start="8794.08" dur="3.3">exactly it&amp;#39;s going to be but you asked</text><text start="8795.819" dur="3.481">when is this going to exist I think to</text><text start="8797.38" dur="4.019">some degree we already have</text><text start="8799.3" dur="4.38">many organizations in the world that are</text><text start="8801.399" dur="3.721">smarter than a single human and and that</text><text start="8803.68" dur="3.54">seems to be something that is generally</text><text start="8805.12" dur="4.04">productive in advancing humanity and</text><text start="8807.22" dur="4.44">somehow the individual AI systems</text><text start="8809.16" dur="4.54">empower the individual humans and the</text><text start="8811.66" dur="4.38">interaction between those humans to make</text><text start="8813.7" dur="4.44">that collective intelligence Machinery</text><text start="8816.04" dur="3.66">that you&amp;#39;re referring to smarter so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8818.14" dur="4.02">not like AI is becoming super</text><text start="8819.7" dur="4.739">intelligent it&amp;#39;s just becoming the uh</text><text start="8822.16" dur="4.44">the engine that&amp;#39;s making the collective</text><text start="8824.439" dur="3.241">intelligence is primarily human more</text><text start="8826.6" dur="3.66">intelligent</text><text start="8827.68" dur="6.48">yeah it&amp;#39;s educating the humans better</text><text start="8830.26" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s making them better informed it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8834.16" dur="4.34">um making it more efficient for them to</text><text start="8835.96" dur="5.16">communicate effectively and debate ideas</text><text start="8838.5" dur="4.18">and through that process just making the</text><text start="8841.12" dur="3.12">whole collective intelligence more and</text><text start="8842.68" dur="4.02">more and more intelligent</text><text start="8844.24" dur="4.26">maybe faster than the individual AI</text><text start="8846.7" dur="5.04">systems that are trained on human data</text><text start="8848.5" dur="4.74">anyway are becoming maybe the collective</text><text start="8851.74" dur="3.9">intelligence of human species might</text><text start="8853.24" dur="4.68">outpace the development of AI</text><text start="8855.64" dur="4.5">just like so there&amp;#39;s a balance in here</text><text start="8857.92" dur="4.439">because I mean if if like you know if a</text><text start="8860.14" dur="4.92">lot of the input that</text><text start="8862.359" dur="4.141">that the systems are being trained on is</text><text start="8865.06" dur="2.46">basically coming from feedback from</text><text start="8866.5" dur="3.42">people</text><text start="8867.52" dur="4.56">then a lot of the development does need</text><text start="8869.92" dur="4.559">to happen in human time right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="8872.08" dur="4.2">not like a machined</text><text start="8874.479" dur="3.481">or just be able to go learn all the</text><text start="8876.28" dur="3.6">stuff about about how people think about</text><text start="8877.96" dur="4.439">stuff there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a cycle to how</text><text start="8879.88" dur="5.7">this needs to work this is an exciting</text><text start="8882.399" dur="5.58">World we&amp;#39;re living in and that you&amp;#39;re at</text><text start="8885.58" dur="4.14">the Forefront of developing uh one of</text><text start="8887.979" dur="4.201">the ways you keep yourself humble like</text><text start="8889.72" dur="4.5">we mentioned with Jiu Jitsu is doing</text><text start="8892.18" dur="5.219">some uh really difficult challenges</text><text start="8894.22" dur="5.88">mental and physical one of those you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="8897.399" dur="3.901">done very recently is uh the Murph</text><text start="8900.1" dur="3.36">challenge</text><text start="8901.3" dur="4.5">and you got a really good time it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="8903.46" dur="5.28">hundred pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 squats</text><text start="8905.8" dur="4.679">and a mile before and a mile run

start="8915.16" dur="4.56">I think a lot of people were very</text><text start="8916.78" dur="5.64">impressed it&amp;#39;s very impressive time</text><text start="8919.72" dur="4.92">yeah how crazy are you it was the</text><text start="8922.42" dur="3.84">question I&amp;#39;m asking but it wasn&amp;#39;t my</text><text start="8924.64" dur="3.78">best time but but I I&amp;#39;m anything under</text><text start="8926.26" dur="4.44">40 minutes I&amp;#39;m happy with yeah um it</text><text start="8928.42" dur="3.66">wasn&amp;#39;t your best time no I think I I</text><text start="8930.7" dur="4.02">think I&amp;#39;ve done it a little faster</text><text start="8932.08" dur="4.98">before but not much I mean it&amp;#39;s um</text><text start="8934.72" dur="4.44">um and and of my friends I I did not win</text><text start="8937.06" dur="3.66">on Memorial Day one of my friends did it</text><text start="8939.16" dur="2.699">actually it was several minutes faster</text><text start="8940.72" dur="2.94">than me</text><text start="8941.859" dur="2.881">um but just to clear up one thing that I</text><text start="8943.66" dur="2.64">think was</text><text start="8944.74"

you&amp;#39;re not also doing push-ups</text><text start="8976.96" dur="4.56">and and squats so so yeah so my I&amp;#39;m sure</text><text start="8979.54" dur="3.779">my own partition time would be

dur="3.779">too many bruises and things that you</text><text start="9108.899" dur="4.981">need to recover from so I do that you</text><text start="9110.939" dur="5.341">know three to four times a week and then</text><text start="9113.88" dur="4.32">um and then the other day is</text><text start="9116.28" dur="3.72">um I just try to do a mix of things like</text><text start="9118.2" dur="3.9">just cardio conditioning strength</text><text start="9120" dur="3.12">building Mobility</text><text start="9122.1" dur="3.42">um so you try to do something physical</text><text start="9123.12" dur="4.44">every day yeah I try to unless I&amp;#39;m just</text><text start="9125.52" dur="3.959">so tired that I just need to</text><text start="9127.56" dur="3.24">need to relax but then I&amp;#39;ll still try to</text><text start="9129.479" dur="3">like go for a walk or something I mean</text><text start="9130.8" dur="3.54">even here</text><text start="9132.479" dur="3.361">um I don&amp;#39;t know have you been on the</text><text start="9134.34" dur="3">roof here yet no we&amp;#39;ll go on the roof</text><text start="9135.84" dur="3.54">after those things but it&amp;#39;s like we</text><text start="9137.34" dur="4.08">designed this this building and I I put</text><text start="9139.38" dur="3.54">a park on the roof so that way that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="9141.42" dur="3.36">like my meetings when I&amp;#39;m just doing</text><text start="9142.92" dur="3.96">kind of a one-on-one or talking to a</text><text start="9144.78" dur="3.84">couple of people I&amp;#39;m I I have a very</text><text start="9146.88" dur="3.599">hard time just sitting I feel like it</text><text start="9148.62" dur="3.3">gets super stiff it like feels really</text><text start="9150.479" dur="2.34">bad</text><text start="9151.92" dur="3.84">um</text><text start="9152.819" dur="5.281">but I don&amp;#39;t know I being physical is</text><text start="9155.76" dur="4.2">very important to me I think it&amp;#39;s um I</text><text start="9158.1" dur="3.18">do not believe this gets to the question</text><text start="9159.96" dur="3.899">about AI</text><text start="9161.28" dur="3.78">I don&amp;#39;t think that a being is just a</text><text start="9163.859" dur="2.881">mind</text><text start="9165.06" dur="2.58">um and I think we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re kind of meant</text><text start="9166.74" dur="4.619">to</text><text start="9167.64" dur="6.66">do things and like physically and and a</text><text start="9171.359" dur="4.561">lot of the sensations that we feel are</text><text start="9174.3" dur="3.179">um are are connected to that and I think</text><text start="9175.92" dur="4.38">that that&amp;#39;s a lot of what makes you a</text><text start="9177.479" dur="4.081">human is is basically you know having</text><text start="9180.3" dur="4.139">those</text><text start="9181.56" dur="3.96">having you know that set of Sensations</text><text start="9184.439" dur="3.54">and</text><text start="9185.52" dur="5.82">experiences around that</text><text start="9187.979" dur="6.96">coupled with a mind to reason about them</text><text start="9191.34" dur="6.24">um but I don&amp;#39;t know I I think it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="9194.939" dur="4.861">important for balance to</text><text start="9197.58" dur="3.96">to kind of get out challenge yourself in</text><text start="9199.8" dur="5.4">different ways learn different skills</text><text start="9201.54" dur="5.88">clear your mind do you think</text><text start="9205.2" dur="5.54">AI in order to become super intelligent</text><text start="9207.42" dur="3.32">in AGI should have a body</text><text start="9211.5" dur="6.479">it depends on on what the goal is I</text><text start="9215.64" dur="4.5">think that there&amp;#39;s this assumption</text><text start="9217.979" dur="5.161">in that question that</text><text start="9220.14" dur="5.58">intelligence intelligence should be kind</text><text start="9223.14" dur="5.04">of person-like whereas you know as we</text><text start="9225.72" dur="5.34">were just talking about</text><text start="9228.18" dur="5.58">um you can have these greater than</text><text start="9231.06" dur="4.68">single human intelligent organisms like</text><text start="9233.76" dur="3.719">the stock market which obviously do not</text><text start="9235.74" dur="4.199">have bodies and do not speak a language</text><text start="9237.479" dur="5.34">right and like you know and and just</text><text start="9239.939" dur="4.141">kind of have their own</text><text start="9242.819" dur="3.241">system</text><text start="9244.08" dur="3.899">um but</text><text start="9246.06" dur="4.02">so I don&amp;#39;t know my guess is</text><text start="9247.979" dur="4.201">um it will there will be limits to what</text><text start="9250.08" dur="4.8">A system that is purely an intelligence</text><text start="9252.18" dur="5.88">can understand about the Human Condition</text><text start="9254.88" dur="4.92">without having the same not just senses</text><text start="9258.06" dur="4.62">but like</text><text start="9259.8" dur="5.28">our bodies change as we get older right</text><text start="9262.68" dur="6.299">and we kind of evolve and</text><text start="9265.08" dur="6.12">I think that those very subtle</text><text start="9268.979" dur="4.681">physical changes</text><text start="9271.2" dur="5.1">just drive a lot of social patterns and</text><text start="9273.66" dur="4.44">behavior around like when you choose to</text><text start="9276.3" dur="3.3">have kids right like just like all these</text><text start="9278.1" dur="3">you know that&amp;#39;s not even subtle that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="9279.6" dur="2.879">major one right but like</text><text start="9281.1" dur="2.52">um you know how you design things around</text><text start="9282.479" dur="4.081">the house</text><text start="9283.62" dur="4.739">um so yeah I mean I think I think it</text><text start="9286.56" dur="3.6">would if the goal is to understand</text><text start="9288.359" dur="3.981">people as much as possible I think I</text><text start="9290.16" dur="4.5">think that that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="9292.34" dur="4.3">trying to model those Sensations is</text><text start="9294.66" dur="3.12">probably somewhat important but I think</text><text start="9296.64" dur="2.82">there&amp;#39;s a lot of value that can be</text><text start="9297.78" dur="3.6">created by having intelligence even that</text><text start="9299.46" dur="4.019">that is that is separate from that is a</text><text start="9301.38" dur="5.64">separate thing uh so one of the features</text><text start="9303.479" dur="7.141">of being human is that we&amp;#39;re mortal we</text><text start="9307.02" dur="7.26">die uh we&amp;#39;ve talked about AI a lot about</text><text start="9310.62" dur="5.279">potentially replicas of ourselves uh do</text><text start="9314.28" dur="3.18">you think there will be AI replicas of</text><text start="9315.899" dur="2.761">you and me that persists long after</text><text start="9317.46" dur="6.2">we&amp;#39;re gone</text><text start="9318.66" dur="5">that family and loved ones can talk to</text><text start="9324.42" dur="3.96">I think we&amp;#39;ll have the capacity to do</text><text start="9326.52" dur="3.72">something like that and I think one of</text><text start="9328.38" dur="4.62">the big questions</text><text start="9330.24" dur="4.14">that we&amp;#39;ve had to struggle with in the</text><text start="9333" dur="4.8">context of</text><text start="9334.38" dur="6.18">social networks is who gets to make that</text><text start="9337.8" dur="4.2">um and you know and my answer to that</text><text start="9340.56" dur="2.879">you know in the context of the work that</text><text start="9342" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re doing is that that should be your</text><text start="9343.439" dur="4.081">choice right I don&amp;#39;t think anyone should</text><text start="9345" dur="5.46">be able to choose to make a Lex spot</text><text start="9347.52" dur="5.22">that people can</text><text start="9350.46" dur="4.5">can choose to talk to and get to train</text><text start="9352.74" dur="3.96">that yeah and we&amp;#39;ve kind of we have this</text><text start="9354.96" dur="2.88">precedent of making some of these calls</text><text start="9356.7" dur="4.739">where</text><text start="9357.84" dur="6.78">I mean someone can create a page for uh</text><text start="9361.439" dur="6.361">a Lex fan club but you can&amp;#39;t create a</text><text start="9364.62" dur="3.9">page and say that you relax yes right</text><text start="9367.8" dur="3.3">um</text><text start="9368.52" dur="4.799">so I think that this similarly I think</text><text start="9371.1" dur="4.44">I mean maybe you know someone maybe can</text><text start="9373.319" dur="4.441">make a should be able to make an AI</text><text start="9375.54" dur="3.48">That&amp;#39;s um that&amp;#39;s a Lex admirer that</text><text start="9377.76" dur="3.24">someone can talk to but I think it</text><text start="9379.02" dur="3.72">should ultimately be your call</text><text start="9381" dur="4.979">whether</text><text start="9382.74" dur="5.6">there is a Lex AI well I&amp;#39;m open sourcing</text><text start="9385.979" dur="2.361">The Lex</text><text start="9388.64" dur="5.799">so uh you&amp;#39;re a man of Faith what what</text><text start="9392.52" dur="3.419">role has Faith played in your life and</text><text start="9394.439" dur="3.301">your understanding of the world and the</text><text start="9395.939" dur="4.641">understanding of your own life</text><text start="9397.74" dur="5.1">and your understanding of uh your work</text><text start="9400.58" dur="5.76">and how to</text><text start="9402.84" dur="3.5">your work impacts the world</text><text start="9406.68" dur="2.52">yeah I think that there&amp;#39;s a few</text><text start="9408" dur="2.939">different parts of this that are</text><text start="9409.2" dur="2.46">relevant</text><text start="9410.939" dur="2.821">um</text><text start="9411.66" dur="3.659">there&amp;#39;s sort of a philosophical part and</text><text start="9413.76" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s a cultural part</text><text start="9415.319" dur="5.761">and one of the most basic lessons is uh</text><text start="9419.7" dur="4.02">right at the beginning of Genesis right</text><text start="9421.08" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s like God creates the Earth and</text><text start="9423.72" dur="5.099">creates people and creates people in</text><text start="9425.819" dur="4.801">God&amp;#39;s image and there&amp;#39;s the question of</text><text start="9428.819" dur="3.66">you know what does that mean and all the</text><text start="9430.62" dur="3.12">only context that you have about God at</text><text start="9432.479" dur="4.081">that point in the Old Testament is that</text><text start="9433.74" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s God has created things so I I</text><text start="9436.56" dur="4.32">always thought that like one of the</text><text start="9437.7" dur="6.54">interesting lessons from that is that</text><text start="9440.88" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s a virtue in creating things</text><text start="9444.24" dur="4.98">that is like whether it&amp;#39;s artistic or</text><text start="9447.6" dur="3.06">whether you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="9449.22" dur="4.02">building things that are functionally</text><text start="9450.66" dur="3.6">useful for other people</text><text start="9453.24" dur="4.02">um</text><text start="9454.26" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;ve got that by itself</text><text start="9457.26" dur="3.48">is a good</text><text start="9459.3" dur="2.94">and</text><text start="9460.74" dur="3.42">I</text><text start="9462.24" dur="2.94">that kind of drives a lot of how I think</text><text start="9464.16" dur="4.68">about</text><text start="9465.18" dur="5.34">morality and my my personal philosophy</text><text start="9468.84" dur="5.16">around like what what is a good life</text><text start="9470.52" dur="6.06">right it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s one where you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="9474" dur="4.859">you know helping the people around you</text><text start="9476.58" dur="5.16">and your</text><text start="9478.859" dur="5.58">being a kind of positive creative force</text><text start="9481.74" dur="4.68">in the world that is helping to you know</text><text start="9484.439" dur="3.721">bring new things into the world whether</text><text start="9486.42" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re you know amazing other people</text><text start="9488.16" dur="5.06">kids or</text><text start="9491.16" dur="2.06">um</text><text start="9493.5" dur="2.88">or just leading to the creation of</text><text start="9495.18" dur="3.48">different things that would have been</text><text start="9496.38" dur="4.62">possible otherwise and so that&amp;#39;s a value</text><text start="9498.66" dur="4.62">for me that that that matters deeply and</text><text start="9501" dur="3.54">I I just I mean I just love you know</text><text start="9503.28" dur="2.82">spending time with the kids and seeing</text><text start="9504.54" dur="4.859">that they sort of you know trying to</text><text start="9506.1" dur="5.339">impart this value to them then</text><text start="9509.399" dur="3.54">um it&amp;#39;s like I mean nothing makes me</text><text start="9511.439" dur="4.321">happier than like when I</text><text start="9512.939" dur="4.681">come home from work and you know I see</text><text start="9515.76" dur="3.48">like my my daughter&amp;#39;s like building</text><text start="9517.62" dur="3.3">Legos on the table or
